In order to ensure the accuracy of our models were not a function of overly-specific hyperparameters, we constructed a large, well balanced holdout set for Acd mutant protein soluble fraction. This holdout was kept consisent for modeling Acd soluble and total yield. For each dependent variable, we have made the entire set, the training set, and holdout sets available.
