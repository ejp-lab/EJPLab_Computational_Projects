# Validation Datasets
Here one will find our datasets prediction through cross validation prediction as described here <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_predict.html#sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_predict>.

Note that we shuffle our datasets before inputting into sklearn.model.selection.cross_val_predict(). We provided cross validation of 5 and 10 on various subsets of data here.
