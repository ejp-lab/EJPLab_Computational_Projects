"If I want to target specific hydrophobic residues and interfere with protein folding, what techniques could I use and how would I measure this with fluorescence?","To monitor the hydrophobic effect in protein folding with fluorescent measurements, a modular procedure involving site-directed mutagenesis and FRET can be employed. To determine how specific hydrophobic residues contribute to the secondary or tertiary structure of a protein of interest, mutagenesis of hydrophobic residues to other residues (polar, or charged residues) can be used. By then attaching a donor and acceptor fluorophore to key regions of the protein of interest it is possible to measure the folding of the protein as a function of FRET efficiency when hydrophobic residues are systematically removed. While this protocol could prove useful, it requires previous knowledge regarding both key hydrophobic residues and important folding motifs about which you may install the FRET donor and acceptor.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0530-8#Sec1,"To target specific hydrophobic residues and interfere with protein folding while measuring the effects with fluorescence, the incorporation of unnatural amino acids containing fluorescent side chains into proteins is a viable technique. This method allows monitoring of protein conformational changes. Utilizing the nonsense suppression approach, various fluorescent unnatural amino acids have been incorporated into proteins. In particular, one study demonstrated the use of two different fluorescent amino acids in dihydrofolate reductase, enabling the observation of protease-mediated cleavage into two fragments through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)【7:1†source】.

In addition to probing protein dynamics and conformational changes, this approach is well-suited for investigating protein stability and activity by introducing novel backbone structures into proteins. The powerful aspect of using fluorescent unnatural amino acids is the ability to visually monitor changes in protein structure or interactions, which is critical for understanding the effects of targeting hydrophobic residues on protein folding【7:2†source】.

For measuring these effects using fluorescence, FRET is a particularly useful technique as it can reveal interactions and distances between different parts of a protein or between proteins by detecting energy transfer between fluorophores. When an unnatural amino acid with a fluorescent side chain is excited by light of a specific wavelength, it can transfer energy to a nearby fluorescent molecule (if within a suitable distance), leading to a fluorescence emission that is detectable. This change in fluorescence intensity or wavelength can be quantitatively measured, offering insights into the structural changes or interactions within proteins.",England_Biochemistry_2004.pdf,R1,R3,R4,R1,R10,R9,R1,R3,R4,R1,R10,R9,R1,R3,R4,R1,R10,R9,R1,R3,R4,R1,R10,R9,R1,R3,R4,R1,R10,R9,5,2,5,5,5,5,5,3,4,5,5,5,4,2,5,5,4,5,5,2,4,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,5
"Before designing <FILTERED> inhibitor, you wish to better understand the consequences of LexA inhibition. Culyba et al. showed that, depending on the dose of DNA damage, the rates of expression of a GFP reporter under the control of three different SOS promoters varied depending on their off rate (Fig. <FILTERED>). The differences in time profiles for SOS gene expression can particularly be seen at high doses of irradiation, inducing strong SOS activation. While this nicely demonstrated the concept of a chronology of SOS responses that might be differently impacted by a LexA cleavage inhibitor, there are some limitations to the study. First, the SOS promoters were all inserted at the same site in the E. coli chromosome in order to use the reporter, rather than measuring transcription of the genes at the native SOS sites. Second, the use of the GFP reporter, while convenient, masks timing effects that might arise differently for the different transcripts and their subsequent translation into active proteins. Third, they inferred that LexA levels would be changing due to cleavage and resynthesis (Fig. <FILTERED>), but did not directly monitor LexA. You can address these issues by using CRISPR technology and native transcriptomics and proteomics readouts. Briefly examine Tong et al., and design <FILTERED> experiment using their PRIME editor system to exchange the SOS promoter between a slow (sulA) site and a fast (dinG) site. Describe how you would then measure transcript levels and protein levels at different timepoints after stimulating DNA damage with UV irradiation, similar to the procedures used in Culyba et al. What result would you expect if you used the PRIME editor to increase the LexA NTD-CTD linker length to <FILTERED> amino acids?","Once the prime editing has been carried out, you can measure protein and transcript levels by looking at the levels of the promoter binding reaction, as that is correlated to protein levels. Culyba et al. showed that one DNA is repaired and protein levels return, it is correlated to the level of the promoter binding. ",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25541-3 ,"To design an experiment using the PRIME editor system for exchanging the SOS promoter between a slow (sulA) site and a fast (dinG) site, I'll outline a step-by-step approach based on the CRISPR technology and then discuss how to measure transcript and protein levels. Following, I'll speculate on the expected outcomes of increasing the LexA NTD-CTD linker length, incorporating general knowledge around LexA regulation and SOS response mechanisms.

### Experiment Design using PRIME Editor

1. **Design PRIME Editor Guide RNAs (pegRNAs):** Develop pegRNAs targeting the genomic locations of the sulA and dinG promoter regions in the E. coli chromosome. These pegRNAs should include a spacer sequence that binds to the target site, a primer-binding site (PBS), and a reverse transcriptase (RT) template containing the sequence to be inserted or swapped.

2. **SOS Promoter Swap:**
   - **Target sulA Site:** Use a pegRNA designed to bind to the sulA promoter region and include the dinG promoter sequence in the RT template for insertion.
   - **Target dinG Site:** Conversely, use a pegRNA targeting the dinG promoter region but include the sulA promoter sequence in the RT template.
   - Successfully engineered cells will have the sulA promoter swapped with the dinG promoter and vice versa.

3. **CRISPR-Cas Delivery:** Introduce the necessary components into E. coli cells—Cas9 nickase, pegRNAs, and the reverse transcriptase enzyme—via a plasmid or viral vectors to effect the genomic edits.

4. **Selection and Verification:** Select genetically modified cells using antibiotic resistance markers or reporter genes included in the delivery vectors. Confirm the promoter swap via PCR amplification and sequencing of the modified genomic regions.

### Transcript and Protein Level Measurement

1. **DNA Damage Induction:** Expose the modified E. coli cells to UV irradiation at a controlled intensity and duration to uniformly induce DNA damage across samples.

2. **Sampling at Timepoints:** Collect samples at various timepoints post-irradiation to capture the dynamics of the SOS response.

3. **Transcriptomic Analysis:**
   - Use quantitative PCR (qPCR) or RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to quantify the mRNA levels of the SOS genes now under the control of swapped promoters.
   - Compare these levels against untreated controls and between the two modified strains.

4. **Proteomic Analysis:**
   - Employ mass spectrometry or Western blotting to measure the protein levels encoded by the SOS genes of interest.
   - Analysis should aim to correlate transcript and protein levels, considering potential delays in translation and protein maturation.

### Expected Outcome

If the PRIME editor is used to increase the LexA NTD-CTD linker length, one might predict a few potential outcomes based on the role of LexA in repressing the SOS response:

1. **Increased Flexibility:** Lengthening the linker could increase the flexibility between the N-terminal DNA-binding domain and the C-terminal dimerization domain, potentially affecting LexA's ability to bind DNA or be cleaved by RecA* co-protease activities.

2. **Altered Cleavage Efficiency:** An added linker length might either hinder or enhance the efficiency with which LexA is cleaved in response to DNA damage, depending on how it influences the overall conformation and accessibility of the cleavage site.

3. **Impact on SOS Response:** Should the cleavage efficiency of LexA be reduced, it could delay or dampen the SOS response, leading to slower induction of SOS genes. Conversely, increased cleavage efficiency could result in an accelerated SOS response.

This experimentally-driven approach, leveraging CRISPR technology and nuanced molecular measurements, allows for a detailed dissection of LexA's role and regulation in the SOS response, providing insights beyond the limitations noted in the Culyba et al. study.",Chem5520_S24_Final_Exam.pdf,R2,R3,R4,R6,R3,R4,R2,R3,R4,R6,R3,R4,R2,R3,R4,R6,R3,R4,R2,R3,R4,R6,R3,R4,R2,R3,R4,R6,R3,R4,5,5,5,2,2,3,1,1,5,5,2,4,5,5,5,2,2,3,5,5,4,2,2,1,5,5,5,3,4,4
How does studying lipids and membrane systems present challenges that are not there for studying proteins or nucleic acids?,"A challenge that lipids provide is that they are generally hydrophobic, making them harder to solubilize. Membrane proteins obviously must be able to penetrate the cell membrane, which is something that the majority of proteins cannot do. Lipids can have a variety of different head groups that vastly alter overall function, while this level of variation is not seen in proteins and nucleic acids. The dynamics of lipids are very fast, as they are able to quickly go from one side of the membrane to another, which can cause a challenge for time based measurements. The organization around membranes is much different than in water systems for proteins and nucleic acids, and many different interactions affect structure.  ",Chem5520_S24_Lecture11a.vtt,"The document did not directly address the challenges unique to studying lipids and membrane systems as compared to proteins or nucleic acids. However, understanding the nature of the challenges can be inferred from the general difficulties faced in the field of membrane and lipid studies. Here are some common challenges:

1. **Diversity and Complexity**: Lipids are a highly diverse group of molecules with structural variations that contribute to the complexity of studying them. Unlike proteins, which are polymers of amino acids, or nucleic acids, which are polymers of nucleotides, lipids can vary widely in their structure, including differences in chain length, saturation, and head-group composition.

2. **Hydrophobicity**: The inherently hydrophobic nature of many lipids makes them difficult to study in aqueous environments, which is in contrast to the relatively straightforward studies of water-soluble proteins or nucleic acids in buffer solutions. This hydrophobicity complicates the extraction, purification, and analysis of lipids.

3. **Membrane Dynamics**: Membranes are dynamic structures, with lipids constantly moving and changing their interactions. This dynamism, along with the asymmetrical distribution of lipids across the bilayer, complicates the study of membrane properties and functions.

4. **Analytical Techniques**: While there have been advances in technologies such as mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance for studying lipids, these methods can still be challenging to apply due to the wide variety of lipid structures and the need for specialized methodologies to resolve and identify them accurately.

5. **Functional Studies**: Unlike proteins, where sequence leads to structure and function can often be inferred, the functions of lipids can be more difficult to deduce due to their diverse roles in membranes, energy storage, signaling, and as precursors to other molecules. Lipids often work together in complex mixtures, and dissecting individual functions can be challenging.

While these points elaborate on general challenges in lipid and membrane studies and not specifically extracted from your document, they highlight the inherent difficulties that distinguish lipid research from studies focused on proteins or nucleic acids.

Which of the following are methods for supervised machine learning? Which of the following are methods for supervised machine learning? Logistic Regression Random Forest Linear Regression Decision Tree,"Supervised machine learning is to train algorithms to classify data or forecast the outcomes by using a labeled data set. Two kinds of problems during data mining for supervised learning: classification and regression. Logistic regression, random forest, linear regression, and decision tree are all supervised machine learning.",Chem 5520 Lecture 14,"The document indeed discusses machine learning methods relevant to protein engineering, specifically mentioning various algorithms that are broadly applicable in supervised machine learning contexts. Here's how they relate to the options you've provided:

1. **Logistic Regression** is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Logistic regression is a statistical model that is used for binary classification problems, which falls under the umbrella of supervised learning.

2. **Random Forest** is highlighted as being particularly useful for small biological datasets, which are often encountered in protein engineering experiments. Random forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time.

3. **Linear Regression** is not specifically called out in the excerpt, but linear models are mentioned as being commonly used as baseline predictors before exploring more complex models. Linear regression itself is a basic form of regression analysis that estimates the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable; it's a fundamental tool in statistics and supervised machine learning for predictive modeling.

4. **Decision Tree** is also discussed in the context of being used within ensemble methods like random forests and boosted trees. Decision trees are a type of supervised learning algorithm (having a predefined target variable) that is used mainly in classification problems.

To summarize, Random Forests and Decision Trees are explicitly mentioned in the document as methods for machine learning, useful in applications of protein engineering. While Logistic Regression and Linear Regression are not directly referenced within the quoted sections, they are well-known techniques within supervised machine learning, with logistic regression being more aligned with classification tasks and linear regression with prediction tasks where the output is a continuous variable.",Yang_NatMethods_2019.pdf,R3,R6,R1,R9,R9,R12,R3,R6,R1,R9,R9,R12,R3,R6,R1,R9,R9,R12,R3,R6,R1,R9,R9,R12,R3,R6,R1,R9,R9,R12,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,2,4,5,5,5,5,4,4,3,5,4,4,3,5,3,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5
Explain simply step-by-step how global metabolomics studies are conducted,"The first step in metabolomics studies is sample preparation, where it is crucial to make sure that you are not altering the sample during preparation. The second step is metabolite extraction, which is usually the most time consuming. Extraction efficiency is highly dependent on solvent, and the most important part of this step is to make sure the metabolites stay stable for analysis. The third step is derivatization, which is not always necessary. This step is to make sure that your analyte is suitable for analysis. An example of this is making sure the sample is ionizable for GC-MS. The fourth step is separation and detection, where mostly chromatography is used to analyze the compounds. The last step is data processing, where the hardest part of this step is determining what each of the metabolites are. Once data is processed, conclusions can be made on the overall nutrition and health of certain foods. ",10.3390/foods11192974,"Global metabolomics studies are conducted through a series of systematic steps designed to measure and analyze the entire set of metabolites (the metabolome) in a biological sample. Here is a simplified, step-by-step explanation of how these studies are typically conducted:

### 1. **Sample Preparation**
Successful metabolomics starts with careful experiment design, including selecting appropriate biological samples (e.g., tissues, cells, biofluids) and controlling experimental variables like diet or media composition. It's critical, especially in in vivo studies, to pay attention to feeding, fasting, and diet composition, and in cell culture studies, to the timing of media changes and the type of media used【42†source】. 

For isotope tracer studies, which can reveal metabolic fluxes (the rates of turnover of metabolites), maintaining a ""metabolic steady state"" is essential. This involves avoiding metabolic perturbations when introducing the tracer by switching into otherwise identical media, with only the labeled form of the nutrient(s) of interest being changed. The duration of labeling depends on which metabolic pathways are being studied and whether the goal is to collect dynamic or steady-state data【44†source】.

After sample collection, immediate preparation is critical to prevent changes in the metabolome. This might involve freezing or adding cold organic solvents to quickly halt metabolic processes, especially for metabolites that turnover quickly【44†source】.

### 2. **Metabolome Measurement**
The metabolome is typically measured using mass spectrometry (MS) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy due to their sensitivity and broad metabolite coverage. These techniques allow for the simultaneous measurement of hundreds to thousands of metabolites in a biological sample【29†source】.

### 3. **Data Processing and Analysis**
After measurement, raw data undergo computational analysis to identify and quantify metabolites. This involves several steps:

- **Peak Identification**: Computational algorithms identify metabolite peaks and align them across samples, distinguishing between genuine metabolites and other signals such as environmental contaminants or fragments【44†source】.
  
- **Quantitation**: Known metabolites can be quantified based on intensity and retention time, using standards for absolute quantitation, while unknowns might be identified through their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and fragmentation patterns, comparing against databases like HMDB or METLIN【44†source】.

- **Statistical Analysis**: This includes comparing metabolite levels across different conditions or treatments, using statistical tests to identify significant changes, and correcting for false discovery rates due to the high number of comparisons in metabolomics studies【45†source】.

- **Pathway Analysis**: Significantly altered metabolites are mapped onto metabolic pathways to understand their biological context and potential impact. This involves using databases like KEGG or MetaCyc and software like MetaboAnalyst to highlight affected pathways and understand the metabolic changes in a broader biological sense【45†source】.

### 4. **Interpretation and Biological Insights**
Finally, the processed and analyzed data are interpreted to draw biological insights. This could involve identifying metabolites associated with specific biological processes, understanding how metabolic pathways are altered under different conditions, and exploring the mechanisms of diseases or responses to treatments. The ultimate goal is to derive meaningful biological conclusions that can inform further research or potential applications in diagnostics, therapeutics, and personalized medicine【45†source】.

These steps represent a framework for conducting global metabolomics studies, with each step requiring careful consideration and expertise to ensure that the data generated are reliable and meaningful.",Jang_Cell_2018.pdf,R1,R8,R4,R6,R10,R4,R1,R8,R4,R6,R10,R4,R1,R8,R4,R6,R10,R4,R1,R8,R4,R6,R10,R4,R1,R8,R4,R6,R10,R4,5,5,4,5,5,3,5,5,5,1,5,2,4,5,4,5,4,2,4,5,4,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5
Explain how the HALO GFP system works and provide a simple experimental example.,"The HALO GFP system works by binding the HALO tag to a fluorescent GFP reporter, which allows you to image the tandem construct. An experimental example of this would be to track organelle delivery to degrative departments. To do this, HALO GFP can be appended to a SEC62, and over time, the delivery of the protein to different parts of the cell can be monitored. Only the parts of the cell which display GFP fluorescence are the parts of the cell which contain the protein. ",https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.E21-10-0526,"The HALO GFP system combines high photostability and brightness from a fluorophore with the targeting specificity provided by the HaloTag protein labeling strategy. Specifically designed for real-time monitoring of calcium ions in living cells, this system revolves around a synthetic calcium sensor that exhibits a substantial increase in fluorescence upon binding calcium. To enable precise localization to proteins of interest within living cells, the sensor incorporates a functional group that allows for covalent attachment to HaloTag fusion proteins. This covalent attachment effectively targets the sensor to specific cellular locations, overcoming limitations like undesired mitochondrial localization commonly encountered with other fluorescent probes.

Here's an overview of how the HALO GFP system works, based on the synthesis and application of a rhodamine-based calcium sensor (referred to as RhoCa-Halo in the document):

1. **Sensor Design and Synthesis:** The sensor combines the favorable qualities of tetramethyl rhodamine (TAMRA) for fluorescence and the specificity of BAPTA, a chelator for calcium ions, to create a compound that very selectively senses calcium ions in the presence of magnesium ions. The synthesis pathway includes modifications that incorporate an iodine for covalent bonding through Sonogashira cross-coupling, allowing for the subsequent attachment of a haloalkane. This haloalkane serves as a substrate for the HaloTag protein, enabling a site-specific attachment to HaloTag fusion proteins.

2. **Targeting and Functionality in Live Cells:** The modified sensor is then used to covalently bind to HaloTag fusion proteins expressed in living cells. For example, the HaloTag protein fused with histone (Halo-H2B), when expressed in nuclei, can be specifically labeled with the rhodamine-based calcium sensor (RhoCa-Halo). The attachment facilitates localized sensing of calcium ions within distinct cellular compartments, like the nucleus, allowing for detailed observation of calcium ion dynamics in living cells with spatiotemporal resolution.

**Experimental Example:**
One application highlighted in the study involved localizing the rhodamine-based calcium sensor to the nucleus by linking it to a nucleus-localized Halo tagged histone protein (H2B). This setup was used to monitor nuclear calcium changes in living cells. The process includes expressing the Halo-H2B fusion protein transiently in cells, followed by labeling with the RhoCa-Halo calcium sensor. Upon stimulation (e.g., with ATP to induce calcium influx), an increase in fluorescence from the sensor can be observed, indicating a rise in nuclear calcium levels. This experiment demonstrates the system's ability to measure spatiotemporal changes in calcium levels within cellular compartments like the nucleus, showcasing the HALO GFP system's utility in live-cell imaging of specific biochemical events【5†source】.",Best_OrgBiomolChem_2016.pdf,R4,R7,R1,R2,R11,R6,R4,R7,R1,R2,R11,R6,R4,R7,R1,R2,R11,R6,R4,R7,R1,R2,R11,R6,R4,R7,R1,R2,R11,R6,5,5,3,5,5,5,5,4,1,5,5,5,5,5,2,5,5,2,5,4,2,5,5,3,5,4,4,5,5,4
can you explain how HALO tags work,"HALO tags work by genetically encoding a 33kDa tag onto a protein that is specific for a HALO tag ligand. When a protein is expressed with the HALO tag, and is exposed to the HALO tag ligand, a covalent bond is formed that is irreversible. Like with any protein modification, the HALO tag can alter the activity of the protein if put in a critical location. The HALO tag can be amended to either the N or C terminus of the protein. Resins specific for HALO tags can be used to purify the protein, binding the HALO tagged protein to the column while other proteins are eluted. The HALO tag ligand provides the HALO tag itself with many applications. Depending on what the ligand is, the HALO tag can provide researchers with the ability to make their protein fluorescent, surface active, or generally reactive to other moieties. ",http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5b00191,"HaloTag technology functions as a versatile and modular protein tagging system, designed to facilitate the covalent attachment of various functional molecules to a protein of interest. This system is based on a modified version of the enzyme haloalkane dehalogenase. The HaloTag protein is engineered to form a covalent bond with synthetic ligands that feature a chloroalkane linker, which can then be attached to different molecules such as fluorescent dyes, affinity handles, or even solid surfaces. This process occurs highly specifically and rapidly under physiological conditions, resulting in an irreversible link between the HaloTag protein and its ligand.

The mechanism involves the HaloTag protein covalently capturing a synthetic ligand through a nucleophilic displacement reaction of a terminal chloride ion facilitated by an amino acid residue (Asp106) in the protein. This reaction forms a stable enzyme-alkyl intermediate; however, unlike in the wild-type dehalogenase enzyme where His272 acts to release the product and regenerate the enzyme, in the HaloTag mutant His272 is replaced with Phe272. This substitution prevents the release and regeneration steps, trapping the substrate as a stable covalent adduct within the enzyme. This unique mechanism is crucial for the HaloTag system's ability to permanently attach a variety of functional groups to proteins for further analytical or preparative purposes.

Through this system, HaloTag serves as a powerful tool for a broad range of applications, including cellular imaging and protein immobilization, by allowing the specific, stable, and functional tagging of proteins either in solution, within living cells, or in fixed cells. This is demonstrated through its utility in analyzing molecular processes associated with NF-κB-mediated cellular physiology, such as imaging subcellular protein translocation and capturing protein-protein and protein-DNA complexes【5†source】.",Los_ACSChemBiol_2008.pdf,R1,R6,R4,R9,R10,R12,R1,R6,R4,R9,R10,R12,R1,R6,R4,R9,R10,R12,R1,R6,R4,R9,R10,R12,R1,R6,R4,R9,R10,R12,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,5
Can you provide a list of all techniques described in Dr. <FILTERED>'s lecture slides? When would you use a microarray? What is the advantage of the bump and hole approach over knockdown assays?,"Unknown DNA molecules are fragmented by restriction endonucleases and tagged with fluorescent markers. These fragments react with probes on a DNA chip, binding to complementary sequences. Unbound fragments are washed away, and the bound fragments are identified by their fluorescence under a laser beam. A computer records the fluorescence pattern, allowing for rapid, sensitive, and specific identification of multiple DNA fragments simultaneously using this DNA chip technique. Based on its principle, microarray can be used in different applications. For example, microarray technology helps researchers identify genetic changes in cancer by comparing gene expression patterns between cancer patients and normal individuals, enabling the detection of SNPs, mutations, cancer biomarkers, tumor classifications, and genes related to chemoresistance and drug discovery, while also being used to study genetic abnormalities and tumor progression, and aiding in the development of diagnostic and prognostic tools for cancer.","Govindarajan, R.; Duraiyan, J.; Kaliyappan, K.; Palanisamy, M.

### Techniques Described in the Lecture Slides
The document discusses several techniques related to microarray fabrication, specifically focusing on the immobilization of small molecules and proteins. The techniques include:
1. **Small molecule immobilization** by combining fluorous interaction and photochemistry.
2. **Small molecule immobilization** by photochemistry between thiol and quinone methide.
3. **Small molecule immobilization** through a reaction between tetrazine and dienophile.
4. **Protein immobilization** by combining oxime ligation and EPL strategy【11†source】.

### When to Use a Microarray
Microarrays should be considered for applications in proteomics that require the functional annotation of proteins, substrate fingerprinting, and ligand/inhibitor binding. Key features of microarrays, such as miniaturization and parallelization, make them particularly suited for these tasks. Microarrays have evolved to support more sophisticated applications, including protein expression profiling, molecular interaction mapping, biomarker discovery, drug discovery, disease diagnosis, and vaccine development【17†source】.

### Advantage of the Bump and Hole Approach
Unfortunately, the document does not directly discuss the ""bump and hole approach"" or its comparison with knockdown assays. However, from what is known outside the document:

The ""bump and hole"" approach refers to a method used in chemical genetics to create a specific interaction between an engineered protein (the ""bump"") and a small molecule (the ""hole""). This is achieved by engineering a small change in the active site of an enzyme or protein, creating a unique pocket that can be specifically targeted by a designed small molecule. The engineered protein retains its normal function but can now be selectively modulated by the small molecule designed to fit the modified site.

**Advantages over knockdown assays** include:
- **Specificity**: The bump and hole approach allows for targeting of specific protein isoforms or family members without affecting others, offering greater specificity than knockdown techniques that might affect all isoforms or members of a protein family.
- **Temporal Control**: It offers real-time control over the modulation of protein function. By administering or withdrawing the small molecule, one can control the timing of protein activation or inhibition, which is more difficult to achieve with knockdown approaches that result in permanent loss of function or require new synthesis for function recovery.
- **Functional Insights**: This method can provide insights into the dynamic roles of specific proteins in live cells or organisms, which knockdown assays cannot easily offer because they do not allow for rapid, reversible modulation of protein activity.

Please include what it is helpful for when investigating biological systems.,"Chemical forward genetics begins with phenotype-based screening of small molecules. Compounds that have a phenotype of interest can be selected. Finally, the target of the compound can be identified. Then, the reverse part needs to overexpress the protein of interest followed by exploration of the ligand for protein of interest by screening. Then, the ligand can help to determine the phenotypic consequences of altering the function of this protein in a cellular context. Traditional forward genetics identifies target genes and pathways by studying of phenotypes caused by random mutagenesis. Reverse genetics starts with a certain gene of interest followed with the gene mutation or altering gene product expression and then identify the phenotype. ",Chem 5520 Lecture 13,"Chemical genetics encompasses both forward and reverse approaches akin to traditional genetics but utilizes small molecules to modulate gene-product function directly. Here's a comparison of these methodologies and their utilities in investigating biological systems:

### Forward Genetics:
- **Traditional Forward Genetics**: Begins with a phenotype of interest and seeks to identify the genes responsible for this phenotype. It typically involves random mutagenesis using DNA damaging agents or radiation to produce mutant strains, which are then screened to identify a gene responsible for a particular phenotype.
- **Forward Chemical Genetics**: Instead employs small molecules to induce a phenotype of interest. Subsequently, the target protein of these molecules is identified, providing insights into the gene's role and the protein's function. It bypasses the need for random mutagenesis, directly affecting gene products to elicit phenotypic changes.

### Reverse Genetics:
- **Traditional Reverse Genetics**: Starts with a gene of interest to understand its function through generation of mutant progeny via gene manipulation, contrasting phenotypic differences between mutant and wild-type. This approach has greatly aided in studying disease by developing various animal models, like knock-outs or knock-ins.
- **Reverse Chemical Genetics**: Focuses on screening a specific protein with libraries of small molecules to identify those that perturb its function. Once a ligand is identified, it's introduced into a system to observe the phenotypic changes, mimicking genetic mutations through chemical means.

### Utility in Investigating Biological Systems:

- **Chemical Genetics Advantages**:
  - **Wider Application**: Particularly useful in systems where traditional genetic manipulation is challenging, e.g., in organisms with diploid genomes, long gestation, or those requiring reversible modulation of gene function.
  - **Temporal Control**: Small molecules can provide rapid, reversible effects allowing real-time, in vivo analysis that is difficult with traditional genetics.
  - **Specificity and Precision**: Allows modulation of specific protein functions, essential for understanding multifunctional proteins or genes coding for multiple proteins. 

- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Generalizability**: At present, chemical genetics is not universally applicable since it requires specific, selective small molecule ligands for each target, which are not always available.
  - **Challenge of Specificity**: Finding chemical entities that are highly specific and free from off-target effects is a significant hurdle.

Chemical genetics offers a distinct advantage over traditional methods by providing more direct, adaptable, and rapid means to manipulate and understand gene function. It's especially valuable in complex, multicellular organisms where classical genetic manipulations are impractical or insufficient for detailed functional analysis【7†source】【9†source】.",OConnor_ChemSocRev_2011.pdf,R1,R6,R9,R9,R10,R12,R1,R6,R9,R9,R10,R12,R1,R6,R9,R9,R10,R12,R1,R6,R9,R9,R10,R12,R1,R6,R9,R9,R10,R12,4,4,5,4,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,4,5,5,3,3,2,3,5,5,4,4,5,4,5,4
Explain LITag,"Light-induced Interactome Tagging (LITag) is a photo-proximity labeling (PPL) approach designed by the Muir lab to capture protein interactomes under a brief exposure to visible light (a few seconds). LITag is fully genetically encoded and is triggered by visible light. In this approach, the protein of interest is genetically fused to an engineered flavoprotein, a small size protein of ~12 kDa with intrinsic fluorescence. This draws the inspiration from the Light-Oxygen-Voltage domains of a small flavin mononucleotide-binding proteins. Upon irradiation with light, the flavin mononucleotide cofactor is excited, leading to covalent labeling of nearby proteins with exogenously added probes through redox-based or energy transfer-based mechanisms. LITag offers high temporal and spatial resolution, having many utilizations, including cellular imaging, protein mapping, and quantitative proteomic applications.",Hananya_PNAS_2023,"The LITag (light-induced tagging) approach is described as a procedure that involves the use of visible light to initiate a redox-mediated labeling pathway, specifically targeting the modification of tyrosine residues within proteins. This approach allows for the spatial and temporal control of protein tagging by employing an optical trigger, enhancing the specificity and utility of protein labeling for various research applications. LITag's methodology includes the incubation of cells with specific biotinylated probes (either biotin-phenol or biotin-aniline), followed by irradiation with blue light to facilitate the tagging of proteins. This process is versatile and can be adapted towards different residues by selecting the appropriate exogenous probe. LITag is considered complementary to other protein labeling (PL) and proximity-based labeling (PBL) techniques, combining the benefits of genetically encoded systems with the precision afforded by light activation. Such a technique is particularly advantageous for studying complex biological systems and interactions, given its ability to precisely control where and when the tagging occurs【7:0†source】【7:2†source】.",Hananya_PNAS_2023.pdf,R1,R4,R9,R1,R10,R11,R1,R4,R9,R1,R10,R11,R1,R4,R9,R1,R10,R11,R1,R4,R9,R1,R10,R11,R1,R4,R9,R1,R10,R11,4,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,4,5,4,5,5,5,4,5,4,5,5,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,4
How do the venus fly trap extracellular sensors work?,"In bacteria, there are different periplasmic proteins that can bind small molecule nutrients like this (e.g. glutamate, calcium, etc.), and they help to sequester these molecules and import them into bacteria. There are different sensor proteins for different small molecules, and there are sensing systems such as the extracellular calcium-sensing. An example of the extracellular sensor is the yellow fluorescent protein called Venus. This features a membrane anchoring domain and a single pass transmembrane domain. The C terminus of the protein helps anchor it in the membrane, and extracellularly, they have what people refer to as the Venus flytrap domains. Upon binding the chemical (e.g. calcium) in the middle of the sensing domain, there will be confirmational movements of the Venus flytrap protein, allowing sequestering and/or movement of the chemical inside the cells under specific conditions. In addition to the native substrates, people have designed unnatural/engineerable systems using the Venus flytrap mechanism. This can be engineered using a directed evolution approach to be selective for new small molecule we’re interested in. Essentially, they can take a wild-type Venus flytrap protein, identify amino acids important for binding of the chemicals (like glutamate), then make mutations to tune the binding for a specific molecule for a specific mechanistic study. The readout of these assays can be FRET.",CHEM5520_S24_Lecture12a,"It appears there has been a misunderstanding. The document results do not mention the Venus flytrap's extracellular sensors but rather discuss technological advancements in measuring extracellular glutamate concentrations using genetically encoded FRET-based sensors. To clarify the operation of Venus flytrap extracellular sensors, I will provide an explanation based on existing biological knowledge.

The Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) captures its prey via a unique mechanism involving sensitive trigger hairs located on the inner surfaces of its trap. These hairs act as mechanical sensors that detect the presence and movement of potential prey. The mechanism works as follows:

1. **Trigger Hairs**: When an insect or spider contacts a hair, the movement of the hair generates an electrical signal. This mechanical disturbance is converted into an action potential, similar to nerve impulses in animals.

2. **Action Potentials**: The trap requires two stimulations of the hairs within approximately 20 seconds to trigger closing, preventing it from shutting due to false alarms like raindrops. This ""double-touch"" mechanism ensures that the plant conserves energy for genuine capture opportunities.

3. **Rapid Closure**: Once the action potentials are triggered according to the required criteria, ions such as calcium are rapidly moved within the trap cells. This action changes the water pressure within the cells (turgor pressure), causing the trap to snap shut fast.

4. **Digestion**: If the prey continues to move and stimulates the trap further, the plant then seals the trap completely and secretes digestive enzymes. This process breaks down the prey, allowing the plant to absorb the necessary nutrients.

The Venus flytrap is an example of a sophisticated plant mechanism that uses electrical signaling and rapid cellular changes, similar to muscle contractions in animals, to capture and digest prey.",Okumoto_PNAS_2005.pdf,R2,R3,R4,R1,R3,R9,R2,R3,R4,R1,R3,R9,R2,R3,R4,R1,R3,R9,R2,R3,R4,R1,R3,R9,R2,R3,R4,R1,R3,R9,1,1,4,5,5,5,5,1,3,5,4,5,1,2,4,5,5,5,1,5,5,4,5,5,1,5,5,5,5,5

Thanks!","LC-MS could be used for quantification of proteins with enzymatic digestion of a protein which helps the development of LC-MS-based proteomics. Based on the Lecture 8, MS/MS can also be used to both identify and quantify proteins.",Chem 5520 Lecture 8,"LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) can be used for both the quantification and identification of proteins. The development of soft ionization techniques, such as ESI (Electrospray Ionization) and MALDI (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization), has enabled the analysis of peptides and proteins not only for their identification but also for their quantification. These advancements have facilitated a variety of MS techniques applied to proteins, extending from identification and quantification to the characterization of large protein-ligand assemblies【5:0†source】.

For an example that can both identify and quantify proteins to see if they are upregulated, quantitative proteomics is particularly well-suited.

What are the advantages of the bump and hole strategy compared to traditional genetics and chemical genetics?,"Traditional genetics start with random or site directed mutagenesis and a redundant biological pathway might cause the whole effort meaningless. Meanwhile, chemical genetics screen with chemical libraries for novel phenotypes. Compared to the traditional genetics, bump and hole strategy is a method in chemical genetics which allows for selective inhibition of a single engineered protein kinase without perturbing the other members of the family. ",Chem 5520 Lecture 13,"The ""bump and hole"" strategy presents several advantages over traditional genetics and chemical genetics approaches, which can be summarized as follows:

1. **Merging Genetic Selectivity with Chemical Flexibility**: The bump and hole strategy combines the selectivity inherent in genetic techniques with the speed and precision of small molecules. This approach modifies proteins (""holes"") and small molecules (""bumps"") to fit together uniquely, allowing for highly specific interactions. This specificity is difficult to achieve with broader genetic or chemical methods that may affect multiple proteins or pathways simultaneously【5:1†source】.

2. **Speed and Dosage Control**: Traditional genetic approaches, such as gene editing or CRISPR techniques, offer poor time resolution and limited control over protein levels. In contrast, the bump and hole strategy, by utilizing small molecule inhibitors, allows for precise control over the timing and dosage of intervention. This precision is particularly valuable in research settings, where understanding the dynamics of biological processes requires fine-tuned manipulation【5:1†source】.

3. **Elegance and Specificity in Targeting**: The technique is praised for its elegance in enabling specific targeting of proteins with small molecules. By editing a protein to create a unique site (""hole"") that matches a designed small molecule (""bump""), researchers can precisely target a protein of interest while avoiding off-target effects on other proteins. This specificity is invaluable in dissecting biological pathways and could be critical in therapeutic settings where off-target effects might cause undesired outcomes【5:1†source】.

4. **Maintaining Natural Protein Activity**: One of the aims of the bump and hole strategy is to modify the protein in such a way that its fundamental kinetics (K_cat and K_m) remain similar to the wild-type. This aspect ensures that the modified protein behaves in a manner that is representative of the natural protein, avoiding alterations that could lead to misinterpretation of results or loss of function【5:1†source】.

5. **Fostering Evolutionary Insights**: The strategy also taps into evolutionary adaptations, such as the gatekeeper residue in kinases, which mammals have evolved to protect against plant toxins that resemble ATP analogs. By understanding and leveraging such evolutionary adaptations, researchers can design more selective and effective bumps, providing both a therapeutic avenue and insights into evolutionary biology【5:2†source】.

In summary, the bump and hole strategy represents a sophisticated blend of genetic specificity and chemical agility that offers distinct advantages for research and potential therapeutic applications, particularly in achieving selective targeting of proteins and controlling intervention dynamics precisely.",Chem5520_S24_Lecture13a.txt,R3,R5,R6,R1,R4,R11,R3,R5,R6,R1,R4,R11,R3,R5,R6,R1,R4,R11,R3,R5,R6,R1,R4,R11,R3,R5,R6,R1,R4,R11,5,5,5,3,4,1,5,5,3,5,3,3,5,5,5,4,4,2,4,5,5,3,3,2,5,5,5,3,4,2
"Hi Dr. ChatGPT, Please explain the different types of fluorescent protein biosensors we discussed in class. When is it beneficial to use one compared to another? Greg -- <FILTERED> Candidate for BA in Biophysics, Biochemistry, and MS in Chemistry <FILTERED> and Diana Vagelos Scholar Program in Molecular Life Sciences University of Pennsylvania Phone Number: <FILTERED>-<FILTERED>-<FILTERED> Email: <FILTERED>","In class, we discussed different types of fluorescent protein biosensors that involves fluorescent proteins such as green fluorescent protein and the likes (e.g. cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins). The first fluorescent protein biosensor strategy is “Ligand Induced Conformational Change” that often involves FRET, in which it involves energy between an excited donor fluorophore to the acceptor fluorophore upon excitation with a wavelength of light (e.g. CFP-YFP FRET protein pairs). The benefit of using FRET is that it is distance-dependent between the two fluorophores; strategic placement of the two fluorophores within the vicinity of each other can help track conformational changes or the motion of a protein of interest that is encoded with the two fluorophores. FRET can also be employed to monitor other cellular activities such as protease activity (e.g. turn on of fluorescent signal upon cleavage and releasing the fluorescent protein tag), kinase activity, etc. The second strategy is using “Single Fluorescent Protein Biosensors” to just monitor the changes in fluorescence of a single fluorescent protein (e.g. CFP, GFP, YFP). Upon changes in the environment (e.g. binding or pH changes), location, conformational changes, or others, the fluorescence can change and/or it can be monitored. The benefit of this approach is that it can be more minimal compared to the cases where they engineer two fluorescent proteins; in addition, this minimal approach can be useful to monitor pH, ion, or ligand induced fluorescent shifts. There are other types of fluorescent protein biosensors that can be used in a wide range of specific purposes to monitor enzyme activities such as: “Protease Induced Acceptor Dequenching” with a protease cleavable peptide/linker (to monitor protease activity); “Phosphorylation Induced Conformational Change” with a kinase substrate and phosphopeptide binding domain (to monitor phosphorylation).",Chem5520_S24_Lecture12a,"The document outlines three primary types of genetically encoded fluorescent protein biosensors used to monitor and measure protein activity or small molecule signals within cells. Here's a summary of each type mentioned:

1. **FRET-based Biosensors**: These sensors function through the phenomenon of Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), where excited state energy is transferred from a donor fluorescent protein to an acceptor. The efficiency of this energy transfer is highly dependent on the distance and orientation between the two fluorophores. This type of sensor is designed such that protein activity or ligand-binding alters the distance or orientation (or both) between the fluorescent proteins, typically using Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) as the donor and Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) as the acceptor.

2. **Single Fluorescent Protein Biosensors**: These rely on a single fluorescent protein where ligand-binding directly alters the optical properties of the protein's chromophore, often affecting its protonation state. This alteration often results in a spectral shift, enabling measurements to be taken at two different wavelengths. This allows for the creation of a signal that can be ratioed for quantitative analysis.

3. **Translocation Biosensors**: The third category includes biosensors that undergo a change in location within the cell in response to specific cues. For example, these sensors can be designed to monitor membrane lipids like phosphatidylinositol phosphates and diacylglycerol. This type has been very useful for tracking the dynamics of signaling processes related to these lipids.

Choosing between these biosensors depends on the specific cellular process or protein activity you wish to observe. **FRET-based biosensors** are particularly useful for detecting changes in the interaction between molecules or conformational changes within a molecule. **Single fluorescent protein biosensors** are excellent for direct measurement of changes in the environment of the chromophore, which can reflect the state of the cellular local milieu or specific ligand binding. **Translocation biosensors**, on the other hand, are beneficial for observing the movement of proteins or lipids within different cellular compartments, providing insight into cellular signaling pathways and dynamics.

Selection among these sensors would be based on the spatial and temporal resolution required, the nature of the protein or signal being studied, and the feasibility of integrating and expressing the sensor in the system of interest. For example, if the study aims to understand conformational changes or interactions within a protein complex, a FRET-based sensor might be most beneficial. If the interest lies in changes in ion concentration or pH, single fluorescent protein biosensors might offer a more straightforward approach. For studies focusing on the dynamics of cellular membranes or compartment-specific signaling events, translocation sensors would be most appropriate【7†source】.",VanEngelenburg_CurrOpinChemBiol_2008.pdf,R6,R2,R9,R4,R12,R3,R6,R2,R9,R4,R12,R3,R6,R2,R9,R4,R12,R3,R6,R2,R9,R4,R12,R3,R6,R2,R9,R4,R12,R3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5
What are small molecule fluorophores and SNAP/HALO tag proteins?,"There are different tagging and probing techniques to visualize, detect, and characterize biological processes or phenomena, including using small molecule fluorophores and using genetically encodable sensors such as SNAP/HALO tag proteins. Small molecule fluorophores, with their small size, ease of use/synthesis, and chemical versatility, are typically small synthetic tags that can be added to the target biomolecules via chemical reactions (e.g. click chemistry) or biological reactions (e.g. self-labeling protein); they often feature a fluorophore, linker, and recognition motif. Small molecule fluorophores offer minimal perturbation to the target’s native functions, and they can be used for a plethora of purposes such as kinetic studies, high-throughput screening, activity-based profiling, imaging, etc. Many of small molecule fluorophores are fluorescent probes such as fluorescein, rhodamine, cyanine, coumarin, BODIPY, etc. However, sometimes small molecule fluorophores lack localization within the cells; in those cases, we can use protein-based tag approaches such as SNAP-Tag or HaloTag. SNAP-Tag, a self-tagging enzyme, derives from human O6-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase. The protein of interest can be genetically encoded to include a SNAP-Tag with a thiol group that will react a fluorescent substrate; upon adding of this substrate, guanine will be released, and the fluorescent tag will be snapped on the protein of interest. HaloTag is another self-labeling protein derived from the haloalkane dehalogenase from R.rhodochrous. A protein of interest can be genetically encoded to include a HaloTag; HaloTagged protein can react with a chloroalkane ligands (chloroalkane linker + reporter group/fluorophores), forming a covalent linkage and allowing labeling/tracking of the proteins in different contexts.",Chem5520_S24_Lecture12b,"Small molecule fluorophores are a class of fluorescent compounds that can be used to label proteins, nucleic acids, or other molecules within cells for the purpose of imaging or tracking their location, distribution, and interactions. These fluorophores absorb light at specific wavelengths and emit light at longer wavelengths, making them valuable tools in microscopy and other bioimaging applications.

SNAP and HALO tags are engineered protein tags that can be genetically fused to a protein of interest in living cells or in vitro. After expression, these tags can be covalently bound by specific small molecule ligands or substrates, often fluorophores for SNAP tags or HALO ligands for HALO tags, which are fluorescently labeled. This covalent binding enables the visualization, tracking, and manipulation of the tagged proteins within cells or in biochemical assays. The use of SNAP and HALO tags allows for specific and stable labeling of proteins with fluorophores or other chemical probes, facilitating a wide range of experimental approaches to study protein function, localization, and dynamics.

These tagging systems have several advantages over direct fusion of fluorescent proteins to target proteins, including smaller tag size, which may minimize perturbations to the function and localization of the protein of interest, and the ability to use a variety of probes with different properties (such as fluorescence wavelengths) by selecting different ligands for the tag. This versatility makes SNAP and HALO tag technologies powerful tools in cell biology and biochemistry for studying proteins in their native cellular context.

how to make a cyclic peptide and attach it to a protein,"There are many ways to make cyclic peptides, and they can either be cyclic from head to tail, by creating a bridge between two side chains, or side chain to terminus. Side chains often used for cyclization are cysteine, lysine, and glutamic acid. Depending on the residue, different conditions would be required to induce cyclization. For example, cysteine can be oxidized allowing for the formation of a disulfide bond.  Many peptides are not able to be cyclized due to their bond angle constraints, and if no cyclized peptide is observed, then the two reactive moieties were unable to form a stable bond. There are a multitude of ways to attach a peptide to a protein, and it is generally not very different from any chemical ligation, although orthogonality is much more important, as there are bound to be many reactive moieties in a protein. One commonly used method is click chemistry to ligate an alkyne to an azide, provided one moiety is put on each the protein and peptide. Overall, creating orthogonal ligation requires (1) a complimentary nucleophile and electrophile pair, (1) intermolecular chemo selective capture, (3) intramolecular acyl transfer.  ",https://doi.org/10.1039/9781788010153-00001,"To make a cyclic peptide and attach it to a protein, a genetically directed approach using a copper(I)-catalyzed Huisgen’s [2+3]-cycloaddition reaction can be applied. This method was exemplified by the cyclization of calmodulin by incorporating unnatural amino acids at specific sites, followed by a triazole formation through a cycloaddition reaction. This approach allows for cyclization at any spatially compatible sites within a protein, not just at the termini.

"Could you please give some pros and cons for each of these different imaging methods in a biological context: <FILTERED> TIRF microscopy (normal or super-resolution), <FILTERED> cryo-ET, and <FILTERED> MS imaging?","Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) is an excellent technique in analyzing biological processes, and protein dynamics at biological interfaces or cell surfaces. By exciting biological phenomena at cell interfaces, it can be utilized in visualizing surface level cellular components such as membrane-bound proteins and axon termini in live cells. A major drawback of TIRF microscopy is its special limitation in being able to measure only a few hundred nanometers into the cell. Because cryo electron tomography (cryo-ET) utilizes frozen slices of a cell or cellular component for imaging, it is unable to be used on live cells. The central advantage of cryo-ET stems from its ability to generate 3D images of cellular components, allowing researchers to visualize relative locations of macromolecular components in vitro. Mass spectrometry imaging (MS imaging) is a technique that utilizes mass spectrometry after ionizing samples to develop images of cell samples. MS imaging can be used to gather information about the spatial distribution of biomolecules within a cell sample and can thus be used to extensively study a cellular proteome or metabolome. The main disadvantage associated with MS imaging it the need for lengthy computational methods to deconvolute MS data to develop images.",https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/96/2/219/60658/Total-internal-reflection-fluorescence-TIRF,"It appears that the document you've uploaded does not directly contain the information needed to list the pros and cons of TIRF microscopy (normal or super-resolution), cryo-ET, and MS imaging in a biological context. However, based on my knowledge, here's a brief overview of each imaging method's advantages and disadvantages:

### TIRF Microscopy (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy)

#### Pros:
- **High-Resolution Imaging Near the Cell Surface:** TIRF microscopy is excellent for observing phenomena very close to the cell membrane because it limits the excitation light to a thin section, reducing background noise.
- **Live Cell Imaging:** Allows for the observation of live cells over time, making it possible to visualize dynamic processes at or near the cell membrane.
- **Reduced Photobleaching & Phototoxicity:** Since illumination is restricted to the vicinity of the glass slide, there's less overall photodamage to cells, facilitating longer observation periods.

#### Cons:
- **Limited Imaging Depth:** TIRF can only illuminate and thus image a very thin slice of the cell adjacent to the glass slide, making it unsuitable for studying internal cell structures deeper within the cell.
- **Requires Flat Surfaces:** The technique relies on total internal reflection at the glass-water interface, which mandates the use of flat surfaces for cell cultures.

### Cryo-Electron Tomography (Cryo-ET)

#### Pros:
- **High-Resolution 3D Images:** Provides high-resolution, three-dimensional views of cell structures at near-atomic resolution in a near-native state, without the need for staining or fixation.
- **Captures Large Volumes:** Can image relatively large volumes of cells or tissues, giving a comprehensive view of the interaction between macromolecular complexes in situ.

#### Cons:
- **Complex Sample Preparation:** Requires rapid freezing of samples in a way that preserves their native state without ice crystal formation, which can be technically challenging.
- **Limited Accessibility:** The need for high-end electron microscopes and computational resources to process the data makes cryo-ET less accessible for many research labs.

### Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MS Imaging)

#### Pros:
- **Chemical Specificity:** Provides detailed molecular information, allowing for the identification and localization of proteins, lipids, and other biomolecules within tissues or cells.
- **No Need for Labels:** Unlike fluorescence-based methods, it doesn't require the use of labels or dyes, maintaining the sample in a more natural state.

#### Cons:
- **Resolution Limits:** The spatial resolution, while continuously improving, is generally lower than that achievable with optical or electron microscopy techniques.
- **Complex Data Analysis:** The interpretation of MS imaging data can be complex and requires sophisticated bioinformatic tools to analyze and visualize the results.

"If I want to target specific hydrophobic residues and interfere with protein folding, can I conjugate <FILTERED> interfering molecule onto hydrophobic residues (nopt changing the amino peptide itself) and how would I measure this with fluorescence?","Random mutagenesis can be used to modify hydrophobic residues of interest in a protein to either polar or charged residues. Protein folding can then be compared to the wild-type (WT) protein by their differing fluorescent emission of an external fluorescent probe. In this case you can either utilize intrinsic fluorophores (ie. Tryptophan) or noncanonical fluorophores (ie. Acridone, BODIPY) and monitor fluorescence emission changes as the fluorophore moves from a more solvent exposed environment to one that is burired within the protein secondary structure. If key folding motifs of the protein of interest are known, it may be possible to utilize FRET experiments in which the fluorescent quenching by the FRET acceptor can be used as a readout for protein folding. Single-molecule techniques such as fluorescence polarization can also be used as a reporter of protein conformation.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667160323000200,"Targeting specific hydrophobic residues and interfering with protein folding by conjugating molecules onto these residues without altering the peptide backbone itself is potentially feasible. For instance, in the realm of researching protein structure and function, methods have been developed to incorporate unnatural amino acids into proteins, including those with hydrophobic characteristics or specialized functionalities. One notable approach involves the use of unnatural amino acids bearing fluorescent side chains, which can be incorporated into proteins using nonsense suppression techniques. This method allows probing into protein conformational changes, structure, and dynamics through fluorescence-based techniques, including fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), to monitor protein-protein interactions and conformational changes in real-time.

As for measuring the effects of such conjugation on protein folding with fluorescence, the inclusion of fluoregenic molecules or fluorescence-quenching pairs within the target protein provides a powerful tool. By strategically incorporating fluorescent unnatural amino acids into the hydrophobic regions of interest, you can directly observe the impact of the conjugated interfering molecules on the protein's folding and function through changes in fluorescence intensity, emission spectra, or FRET efficiency in response to conformational changes. This approach offers a highly sensitive means to study protein folding dynamics, structural alterations, and the effects of specific interactions on protein behavior in vitro or potentially in live cells.

To implement this effectively, one would need to design the conjugation of the interfering molecule in such a way that it specifically targets the desired hydrophobic residues without disrupting the overall structure or function of the protein more than intended. Subsequent fluorescence measurements would then provide insights into how these modifications affect protein folding. Techniques could include direct observation of fluorescence changes upon folding or unfolding, comparative studies with and without the conjugated molecule, and utilizing FRET to study intramolecular distances and conformational changes related to the protein folding state.

Such studies would not only require a thorough understanding of the protein's structure and folding pathway but also a careful selection of the fluorescence-reporting unnatural amino acids and the interfering molecules to ensure specificity and measurable effects. The development and application of these techniques hold considerable promise for exploring the complex dynamics of protein folding and interaction networks at a molecular level.",England_Biochemistry_2004.pdf,R1,R8,R4,R6,R10,R4,R1,R8,R4,R6,R10,R4,R1,R8,R4,R6,R10,R4,R1,R8,R4,R6,R10,R4,R1,R8,R4,R6,R10,R4,4,3,5,1,3,2,4,3,3,1,4,2,4,2,4,2,3,4,4,2,4,3,4,5,4,5,5,5,4,5

Choose two and describe the pros and cons of one method vs. another.","Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) is a process by which an evanescent wave can be used to image some process at a biological interface or on the surface of a cell. Cryo ET is a process by which 3D images of flash frozen slice of a cell structure or organism can be obtained with an electron microscope. Whereas Cryo ET can develop 3D images of parts of non-living cell other than the cell surface, TIRF imaging has the advantage of being able to image living cells at biological interfaces.",https://www.nature.com/articles/milelight13,"Based on the information available from the document regarding TIRF microscopy and without direct details on cryo-ET, I'll provide a comparative analysis using my existing knowledge.

### TIRF Microscopy【11†source】

**Pros:**
- TIRF microscopy is highly effective for imaging processes occurring near the cell membrane because it excels in reducing background fluorescence from above or below the focal plane. This ensures high-contrast images of events at the cell surface.
- It has the capacity for real-time imaging, providing insights into dynamic cellular processes close to the plasma membrane.
- TIRF can be combined with super-resolution techniques such as dSTORM or PALM to achieve imaging beyond the diffraction limit, offering even finer structural details.

**Cons:**
- Its application is limited to the immediate vicinity of the cell membrane; thus, it is not suitable for imaging structures deep within the cell.
- The requirement for specific fluorophores and high irradiation intensities for super-resolution might limit its use in live-cell experiments due to potential phototoxic effects.
- Achieving super-resolution with TIRF necessitates complex post-imaging processing and analysis, particularly for stochastic approaches which require algorithmic event detection and image reconstruction.

### Cryo-Electron Tomography (Cryo-ET)

**Pros:**
- Cryo-ET allows the visualization of cellular and subcellular structures in their native state without dyes or fixation, preserving physiological accuracy.
- It provides three-dimensional images at nanometer resolution, enabling the study of complex cellular architectures and interactions among macromolecules.
- Suitable for a wide range of biological samples, from small viruses to sections of larger cells.

**Cons:**
- Technically challenging and time-consuming setup, requiring significant expertise and infrastructure, including sophisticated cryo-electron microscopes and preparation facilities.
- The need for cryo-fixation can limit sample viability and restricts the possibility of dynamic imaging.
- Image acquisition and processing are complex and computationally intensive, often requiring extensive manual annotation and computation.

### Comparison

- **Applicability and Focus**: TIRF microscopy is tailored towards events at the cell membrane, offering high-resolution and real-time imaging capabilities, but is limited in its depth of investigation. Cryo-ET, however, provides 3D visualizations of the whole cellular architecture down to the macromolecular level, covering a broader range of biological structures but without the dynamism provided by live-cell imaging.
- **Resolution and Dimensionality**: TIRF enhanced with super-resolution techniques can achieve lateral resolution in the scale of tens of nanometers, primarily in two dimensions. Cryo-ET offers 3D spatial resolution, also in the tens of nanometers, providing a more holistic view of cellular structures.
- **Sample Preparation and Imaging Conditions**: TIRF requires elaborate fluorophore labeling and can potentially induce photodamage, limiting its use in certain live-cell applications. Cryo-ET's sample preparation preserves a near-native state without the need for dyes but precludes the study of living samples.

Each method possesses distinct advantages tailored to specific research needs, with the choice between them depending on the required resolution, sample condition specificity, and the spatial dimensionality of the target structures.",Schermelleh_NatCellBiol_2019.pdf,R4,R5,R1,R1,R11,R11,R4,R5,R1,R1,R11,R11,R4,R5,R1,R1,R11,R11,R4,R5,R1,R1,R11,R11,R4,R5,R1,R1,R11,R11,5,4,5,3,3,2,4,2,5,2,3,3,5,3,4,4,4,4,5,2,2,3,2,1,5,4,5,4,4,3
"If molecule x binding to molecule y is dependent on <FILTERED> factors (structure and sequence) and I have data on for how binding is effected after mutations that change both structure and function at the same time, can I use PCA to determine the relative extents to which the two factors, individually, impact binding?","If you have only done this one mutation, then no, it is not possible to determine how much each of the two factors has impacted binding. A core principal of PCA is that the two components must be orthogonal to each other, and in this case, structure and function are not orthogonal. If PCA were to be used for this purpose, a mutation would have to be made where the sequence is changed, and one of either structure and function are not. ",https://doi.org/10.1002/wics.101,"Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset. It's often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set. When it comes to analyzing the effects of mutations on molecular binding, PCA can be used under certain conditions, bearing in mind its limitations and the nature of your data.

Given that molecule x binding to molecule y is dependent on structure and sequence, and you have data on how binding is affected after mutations that change both structure and function simultaneously, PCA could help to identify the principal components that account for the most variance in your binding data. Here's how it could work and its limitations:

1. **Data Representation**: Ensure that your data accurately represents variations in both structure and sequence. Each mutation affecting structure and function would need to be quantified in a manner that PCA can process. This often means encoding structural and functional changes numerically.

2. **Principal Components**: PCA would allow you to extract principal components (PCs) from your data. These PCs can potentially represent the underlying factors (structure and sequence changes) that most strongly influence binding. The first few principal components may capture the most significant variations in binding affinity caused by mutations.

3. **Interpretation and Limitations**:
   - **Relative Impact Assessment**: If the PCs clearly segregate structural changes from sequence changes (which might be evident by analyzing the loadings of each original variable on the principal components), PCA may help infer their relative impacts on binding. Still, the interpretability is highly dependent on how distinct these factors are in contributing to the variance captured by the PCs.
   - **Correlated Changes**: A major limitation is when the changes in structure and function due to mutations are highly correlated. PCA by itself does not distinguish causality or directionality; it merely captures variance. If structure and sequence changes are tightly linked (not independent or have a linear relationship), PCA might not effectively separate their individual impacts on binding.
   - **Biological Interpretation**: PCA is fundamentally a mathematical tool. While it can highlight which mutations (and associated changes) explain the most variance in binding affinity, interpreting these components in biological terms (e.g., the precise mechanisms by which structure vs. sequence influences binding) requires further analysis beyond PCA, often involving domain-specific knowledge or additional experimental validation.

4. **Supplementary Techniques**: Due to the limitations of PCA in dissecting intertwined effects, you might consider integrating PCA with other approaches. Regression analysis, for instance, could assess the relative contribution of structural versus sequence changes to binding affinity if you can quantitatively separate these two types of changes. Additionally, machine learning models could be trained to predict binding affinity based on structure and sequence separately, providing another angle to assess their impacts.

In summary, PCA can be a starting point to analyze the relative effects of structure and sequence on molecular binding, especially in uncovering patterns of variance related to mutations. However, due to its limitations in distinguishing between correlated factors and in providing direct biological insights, it should ideally be part of a broader analytical strategy that includes additional statistical methods or experimental follow-up to fully understand the individual impacts of structure and function on molecular binding.",Yang_NatMethods_2019.pdf,R3,R2,R1,R4,R9,R3,R3,R2,R1,R4,R9,R3,R3,R2,R1,R4,R9,R3,R3,R2,R1,R4,R9,R3,R3,R2,R1,R4,R9,R3,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,2,4,5,5,5,5,3,4,5,5,4,4,4,3,5,5,4,5,4,4,5,5,5

Can you explain MAGE biochemistry technique please,"Multiplex automated genome engineering or “MAGE” is a recombinant engineering tool utilized to introduce many nucleotide or genome level modifications into cells to enhance genome diversity in a highly efficient, inexpensive and automated manner. Large scale genetic manipulation can be accomplished with this technique by introducing and directing a pool of synthetic single-stranded DNA to anneal to the lagging strand during DNA replication, incorporating mutations into chromosomes following replication. Following successive DNA replication cycles, large scale genetic variation can be induced in a matter of hours to introduce genetic diversity into a group of cells.",https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08187,"The Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) technique is a biochemistry methodology designed for large-scale programming and evolution of cells. MAGE enables simultaneous targeting of many locations on the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, thus producing combinatorial genomic diversity. This combinatorial diversity facilitates the rapid and continuous generation of genetic changes, including mismatches, insertions, and deletions, driving the evolution of cells with new and improved properties.

MAGE utilizes cycles that are both cyclical and scalable, making it possible to automate the technique for rapid generation of diverse genetic changes. For instance, MAGE was applied to optimize the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) biosynthesis pathway in *Escherichia coli* to overproduce the industrially important isoprenoid lycopene. Through this process, 24 genetic components in the DXP pathway were modified simultaneously using a complex pool of synthetic DNA, creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic variants per day. This methodology allowed the isolation of variants with more than fivefold increase in lycopene production within just 3 days.

The efficiency of MAGE has been enhanced by optimizing parameters to maximize the efficiency of oligo-mediated allelic replacement, allowing for new genetic modifications in more than 30% of the cell population every 2 to 2.5 hours. The modifications include generating mismatches, insertions, and deletions with varying efficiencies depending on the amount of homologous sequence between the oligo and its chromosomal target or the size of the deletion. This selectivity and efficiency enable the tunable generation of divergent sequences along favorable evolutionary paths.

In summary, MAGE is a powerful tool for expediting the design and evolution of organisms with enhanced industrial, medical, or research applications by offering a scalable, automated solution for the rapid and continuous generation of genomic diversity【5†source】.",Wang_Nature_2009.pdf,R4,R3,R1,R1,R11,R9,R4,R3,R1,R1,R11,R9,R4,R3,R1,R1,R11,R9,R4,R3,R1,R1,R11,R9,R4,R3,R1,R1,R11,R9,4,5,1,5,5,5,5,4,4,5,4,5,5,4,2,5,4,5,4,4,2,5,3,4,5,4,4,5,4,5
"I'm studying a single stranded RNA genome. I'm interested in the ability for <FILTERED>, a viral polymerase, to bind and replicate a particular region of this RNA to enable proliferation.

I'm quantifying <FILTERED> binding by looking at viral genome copy number. My question: is there any way I can eliminate the secondary structure of this stem-loop with high degree of specificity (ie. don't disrupt the structure of other cellular proteins) without changing sequence at all?","RNAi can be a way to use double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to suppress the gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. Although it always used for gene silencing, it can also be adapted to target specific RNA structures for degradation and structural disruption. ",Chem 5520 Lecture 6,"Eliminating the secondary structure of an RNA stem-loop with high specificity without altering the primary sequence presents a significant challenge due to the inherent relationship between sequence and structure in RNA molecules. However, there are strategies that can be employed to disrupt or modify RNA secondary structures without changing the nucleotide sequence:

1. **Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASOs):** These are short, synthetic nucleotide sequences designed to bind to their complementary RNA sequences through standard nucleic acid base pairing. While traditionally used to block RNA function by sterically hindering the interaction with proteins or by inducing degradation, modified ASOs can be designed to disrupt secondary structures specifically. By binding to one region of the stem-loop, they can prevent base pairing, effectively 'opening' the structure. The specificity can be very high, designed to only bind to your region of interest, minimizing off-target effects.

2. **Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNAs):** PNAs are synthetic polymers structurally similar to nucleic acids but with a peptide backbone instead of a sugar-phosphate one. Their binding to RNA can disrupt secondary structures without altering the RNA sequence. PNAs offer stronger and more specific binding than DNA or RNA oligomers due to their neutral backbone, leading to less interference from cellular proteins.

3. **Locked Nucleic Acids (LNAs):** LNAs are a type of modified RNA nucleotide where the ribose ring is 'locked' by a methylene bridge, enhancing hybridization properties to target RNA. By incorporating LNAs into antisense oligonucleotides targeting regions forming secondary structures, one could enhance binding specificity and affinity, potentially disrupting the formation of the stem-loop structure.

4. **Small Molecules:** Certain small molecules can specifically bind to RNA and alter its structure. Though finding a molecule that specifically targets your RNA stem-loop without affecting other RNAs or proteins can be challenging, high-throughput screening methods or structure-based design might identify candidates. Some molecules have been known to stabilize or destabilize specific RNA motifs.

5. **Ribozymes or Deoxyribozymes:** Engineered catalytic RNA or DNA molecules can be designed to specifically recognize and cleave RNA at desired sites, potentially altering secondary structures. While this may indirectly change the sequence if cleavage occurs, carefully designed ribozymes/deoxyribozymes can act in a reversible manner or target regions flanking your structure to modify its stability without altering the sequence of interest.

It's important to note that all these strategies require careful design and empirical validation to ensure specificity for the target RNA region and minimal off-target effects. Additionally, the impact of disrupting the secondary structure on <FILTERED> binding and viral proliferation would need to be assessed using your specified quantification method, such as measuring changes in viral genome copy number.",Tuerk_Science_1990.pdf,R8,R3,R6,R6,R4,R4,R8,R3,R6,R6,R4,R4,R8,R3,R6,R6,R4,R4,R8,R3,R6,R6,R4,R4,R8,R3,R6,R6,R4,R4,5,5,5,2,2,5,1,5,2,5,3,5,5,5,5,2,1,5,4,5,4,3,1,5,5,5,5,4,4,5
what are sulA and dinG in the context of SOS gene,"SOS response is an inducible response that allows bacteria to survive sudden DNA damage. Two major proteins whose expression is induced during the SOS response are sulA and dinG proteins. The sulA cytoplasmic protein plays a major role in inhibiting cell division. During an SOS response, the inhibition of cell division gives the bacterial cell time to fix DNA damage prior to replication. dinG is an inducible DNA helicase whose function is to unwind both DNA:DNA and DNA:RNA duplexes. This helicase has been shown to be involved in both recombinational DNA repair and the resumption of replication after DNA damage. Both inducible proteins play a major role in the repair of DNA damage and maintenance of cell viability following an SOS response.","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6941525/#:~:text=During%20SOS%20induction%2C%20Escherichia%20coli%20expresses%20a%20cytoplasmic,Lon%20protease%2C%20allowing%20for%20cell%20division%20to%20resume.","In the context of SOS genes, sulA and dinG are promoters that are regulated by LexA.

why would one use first gen <FILTERED>+ fluorescent sensor over second generation sensor?,"The first approach is the use of Ca2+ fluorescent sensor as small molecule fluorescent indicators and the second approach is the use of fluorescent calcium indicator proteins (e.g. fluorescent calcium indicator protein - FCIPs or genetically encoded calcium indicators -GECIs). In cases where localized probes are needed to track the origin and destination of Ca2+, we can have small molecule fluorescent probes specifically targeted that location (e.g. signals in the mitochondria with no interference from the cytoplasm). However, it can be challenging to direct small molecule probes to specific locations. Thus, different generations of genetically encoded fluorescent sensors (FCIPs/GECIs or aequorin-based probes) have been developed to monitor Ca2+ signal, especially at the ER, mitochondria, and the plasma membrane. The first generation entails a recombinant calcium binding domain in the middle of a fluorescent protein pairs (e.g. CFP and YFP); these are called cameleon variants, featuring interactions between calmodulin, which is helpful for a large range of calcium concentration change. In other words, these have a lower dynamic range and slower response kinetics. If we want to monitor that have a shaper turn on with a high increase fluorescence as the calcium concentration changes, we can use the second-generation sensor in which the beta barrel is tweaked, and a calcium binding domain can be inserted within a single fluorescent protein GFP. This second generation is more helpful if we want a sharp turn on within a narrow range of calcium concentrations. So depending on the applications and the range of calcium concentration (and it ranges), we would prefer Ca2+ signal, fluorescent sensor over the second generation.",CHEM5520_S24_Lecture12a,"The specific comparison or advantages of first-generation vs. second-generation fluorescent sensors are not directly outlined in the initial search results within the document. However, generally speaking, the choice between first-generation and second-generation fluorescent sensors might depend on several factors including sensitivity, specificity, ease of use, the complexity of preparation, and the cost of materials or manufacturing.

### First-Generation Sensors:
- **Sensitivity and Specificity**: First-generation sensors might offer sufficient sensitivity and specificity for a range of applications, making them a suitable choice when these levels meet the needs of the experimental setup.
- **Simplicity and Cost**: They may be simpler in design and cheaper to produce or procure. In scenarios where cost is a critical factor, this makes first-generation sensors an attractive option.
- **Established Performance**: Having been around for longer, first-generation sensors might have well-established performance metrics across various conditions, providing a level of reliability and predictability.

### Second-Generation Sensors:
- **Enhanced Sensitivity and Specificity**: Second-generation sensors are usually designed to overcome the limitations of their predecessors, offering improved sensitivity and specificity. This is crucial for detecting low-abundance targets or in applications where precision is paramount.
- **Advanced Features**: They may incorporate advanced features, such as improved stability, reduced background noise, or multiplexing capabilities, expanding their applicability in complex biological systems.
- **Higher Cost and Complexity**: The enhancements and advanced features of second-generation sensors often come at the price of increased cost and complexity in production and use.

In choosing a first-generation sensor over a more advanced second-generation tool, researchers might prioritize cost, simplicity, and the adequacy of detection capabilities for their specific needs over the advanced features offered by newer models.

Explain phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) step-by-step in a basic way,"Phase assisted continuous evolution or “PACE” is a technique utilized in the directed evolution of proteins on a much faster timescale than previous methods. In this procedure, a fixed volume (lagoon) that is continuously diluted with E. Coli cells, is given the selection phage (SP), an accessory plasmid (AP) and a mutagenesis plasmid (MP). The selection phage encodes a protein of interest (POI) that induces the AP to produce gIII, which is a minor coat protein that is essential for both host cell infection and phage particle detachment during assembly. In this way, viable SP are selected for by only allowing POI producing phages to propagate. The MP then contains genetic information that allows for the inducible mutagenesis of the SP POI, allowing for simultaneous directed evolution and selection of the POI.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-00410-3#Sec1,"Phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE) can be described in a basic step-by-step way as follows:

1. **Gene of Interest Selection and Phage Modification**: In PACE, the gene encoding a critical phage coat protein, pIII, is removed from the genome of the M13 bacteriophage and replaced with the gene of interest that researchers want to evolve.

2. **Setup of the Evolution System**: A continuous culture system, such as a turbidostat or chemostat, is used. This system ensures a constant supply of fresh E. coli host cells to the evolving phage population, preventing the accumulation of unwanted mutations in the host genome.

3. **Expression of pIII in Host Cells**: Within the host E. coli cells, a synthetic plasmid (a small DNA molecule within a cell that is physically separated from chromosomal DNA and can replicate independently) carries the instructions to produce pIII, but only in response to a desired function of the gene of interest. This creates a situation where only phages that can trigger the production of pIII can continue to infect new host cells and replicate.

4. **Selection and Evolution Process**: Phages that cannot induce pIII production cannot infect new host cells successfully and are therefore ""washed out"" or removed by the continuous flow of new medium and host cells into the system. This selective pressure ensures that only phages with mutations beneficial to the desired function of the gene of interest continue to propagate.

5. **Enhanced Mutation Rates**: An inducible 'mutagenesis plasmid' within the host cells can be activated to increase the mutation rates of the phage, creating genetic diversity and speeding up the evolution process. This allows researchers to generate mutations at a higher than natural rate, pushing the evolution of the gene of interest at an accelerated pace.

6. **Outcome**: As a result, within a relatively short period, the gene of interest can undergo significant evolutionary changes, producing new functionalities that can be studied or utilized in various applications. PACE enables the rapid evolution of proteins, RNA polymerases, and other molecular entities by linking their functions directly to the survival and propagation of phages in the system【7:0†source】.

micro map vs. mass spec cross linking in the context of carbene,"MicroMap is a microenvironment mapping method developed by the MacMillan lab in which they use photocatalytic carbene generation to selectively identify protein-protein interactions. Carbenes can normally cross link with C-H bonds present in biomolecules. For MicroMap, a photocatalyst-antibody conjugate can spatially localize carbene generation, selectively labeling the antibody binding targets and their microenvironment neighbors. The photocatalyst-antibody conjugate features an iridium catalyst that could sensitize diazirines upon light irradiation via a Dexter energy transfer mechanism, in which the diazirine is excited to its T1 state and then triplet diazirine undergoes elimination to generate a triplet carbene, which can cross-link with nearby protein. This provides great spatiotemporal resolution to probe protein assemblies on the cell surface at nanoscale (t ½ = 1 ns) with great precision (no activation outside photocatalytic radius). On the other hand, cross-linking mass spectrometry often features a cross-linkers comprised of reactive end groups and a spacer. Diazirine has been used as a reactive end group in cross-linking mass spectrometry. Upon irradiation with light, the diazirine becomes reactive carbene, allowing cross linking of interacting proteins for mass spectrometry analysis and structural mapping.  ",Geri_Science_2020,"The document discusses chemical and UV cross-linking in the context of structural biology without specifically focusing on carbene or contrasting micro map vs. mass spec cross-linking techniques. It mentions chemical cross-linking as the covalent linkage of amino acid side chains in close proximity using bi-functional cross-linking reagents. These cross-links are identified after sequencing cross-linked dipeptides post-protein hydrolysis, requiring purpose-built software due to their origination from different protein regions or subunits. The document also notes the use of stable isotope-labelled cross-linkers to yield peak pairs in mass spectra, thus facilitating identification and data evaluation. Chemical cross-linking has been highlighted as a powerful tool for the structural investigation of large protein networks and generating structural models through computational modeling approaches. The text primarily describes lysine-specific cross-linking reagents but acknowledges the existence of various other reagents specific to different functional groups of amino acid side chains【7:0†source】.

- **Micro Map**: Micro map techniques, often related to microscopy or microscale mapping of proteins and their interactions, differ from mass spec cross-linking as they provide localized information about the structure or function of proteins in cells but are not detailed in the provided excerpt.
- **Mass Spec Cross-Linking**: Mass spectrometry (MS) cross-linking involves covalently linking two amino acids that are in close proximity within a protein or between proteins in a complex, followed by MS analysis to identify these cross-links. This technique provides insight into the proximal relationships between amino acids, thereby inferring structural information.
- **Carbene Cross-Linking**: In the context of carbene, it typically refers to the generation of reactive carbene species that can insert into C-H bonds among other reactions, but its specific application or comparison to mass spec cross-linking or micro map techniques was not addressed in the document excerpt.

The discussion in the document primarily focuses on advances in mass spectrometry and chemical cross-linking methods for structural biology, including techniques and strategies to enhance the analysis and modeling of protein complexes and interactions. It does not provide a comparison between ""micro map vs. mass spec cross-linking"" specifically in the context of carbene. For specialized applications like carbene-mediated cross-linking, the literature would typically explore the chemical mechanism and utility of carbene species in protein chemistry, often involving the generation of carbenes through photochemical or chemical methods and their subsequent reaction with protein substrates to elucidate structural information or stabilize interactions for analytical purposes.",Schmidt_JMolBiol_2016.pdf,R8,R5,R6,R1,R4,R11,R8,R5,R6,R1,R4,R11,R8,R5,R6,R1,R4,R11,R8,R5,R6,R1,R4,R11,R8,R5,R6,R1,R4,R11,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,4,3,5,4,4,5,4,5,4,4,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,4,5
Explain what directed evolution is in biochem terms,"Directed evolution is a general term used to describe the attempts of biochemists to mimic natural selection and phenotype variation in lab timescales to develop biomolecules with altered activity. The overall principle of directed evolution oscillates between gene diversification via random mutagenesis and screening for selection of functional gene mutants. In this way, directed evolution can be used to develop proteins or other biomolecules that can maintain or enhance function despite genetic variation.",https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3927,"Directed evolution in biochemistry refers to a process pioneered in 1967 by Sol Spiegelman, which employs Darwinian principles to generate or improve molecules with desired functions. This methodology relies on creating genetic diversity, translating the genetic variants into protein or nucleic acid variants, selecting those variants that exhibit beneficial properties, and replicating the genetic information of these advantageous variants for further evolution cycles. Directed evolution accelerates the laboratory evolution of biomolecules for applications such as novel therapeutics and biotechnology tools, leveraging the significant advances and cost reductions in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies.

Continuous directed evolution, a specific mode of directed evolution, automates all these steps to significantly reduce the effort and time required from researchers. This approach is characterized by not needing manual intervention by researchers to move from genotype—the genetic makeup of an organism—to phenotype—the observable characteristics. Continuous evolution techniques are particularly beneficial for large-scale exploration and iterative improvements across biomolecules' functional landscapes, such as enzymes and binding proteins, resulting in substantial phenotype changes over practical timeframes.

Continuous evolution can be applied both in vitro and in vivo, with various systems developed to facilitate the evolution of nucleic acids and proteins with desired functional traits. The method's efficiency lies in its ability to mimic natural evolutionary processes, allowing for the rapid and extensive exploration of genetic sequence spaces and functional capabilities of biomolecules【5†source】.",Morrison_NatChemBiol_2020.pdf,R6,R7,R9,R2,R12,R6,R6,R7,R9,R2,R12,R6,R6,R7,R9,R2,R12,R6,R6,R7,R9,R2,R12,R6,R6,R7,R9,R2,R12,R6,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,3,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4
define the following in list format and include what situations they are useful for labelling proteins uMAP LiTAG MS crosslinking APEX,"uMap: A proximity labeling method in which an antibody conjugate is conjugated to an iridium catalyst that can sensitize diazirines to generate carbene upon light irradiation. The active carbene species can cross-link with nearby protein(s). This can be used to spatially precise microenvironment labeling of proteins on the cell surface for proteomics and microenvironmental structural mapping; this method offers more precise/localized label compared to some other methods. Examples include investigating neighboring proteins in live lymphocytes, at immunosynaptic junction, etc. LITag: Light-induced Interactome Tagging (LITag) is a fully genetically encoded, photo-proximity labeling (PPL) approach. The protein of interest is genetically fused to a small engineered flavoprotein with intrinsic fluorescence. Upon irradiation with light, the flavin mononucleotide cofactor is excited, leading to covalent labeling of nearby proteins with exogenously added probes through redox-based or energy transfer-based mechanisms. LITag offers high temporal and spatial resolution, having many utilizations, including cellular imaging, protein mapping, and quantitative proteomic applications. MS crosslinking: MS crosslinker utilizes reactions where new covalent bonds were added between proximal molecules/residues. Cross-linking mass spectrometry often features a cross-linkers comprised of reactive end groups and a spacer. The reactive groups depend on which amino acid is being targeted and the spacer can be tuned for reactivity. MS crosslinking is helpful for comparative studies, building interactomics, and deciphering cellular interaction networks (e.g. PPI mapping).  APEX: APEX proximity-labeling method based on protein biotinylation. APEX can be directed to a specific location inside the cell by fusing a protein of interest or a signal motif for localization. Peroxidases, APEX2, is a second generation of APEX protein, that uses hydrogen peroxide to catalyze the oxidation of biotin-phenol to generate a phenoxy radical. This phenoxy radical subsequently can react with electron-rich residues in proximal proteins, which are predominantly tyrosine, thereby biotinylating the molecules. These biotinylated molecules will then be pulldown by streptavidin, allowing for protein characterization and quantification by MS techniques. APEX2 can be more versatile than techniques such as LITag and APEX2 is appropriate to investigate vault protein. However, the limitation of APEX2 labeling is the possible toxicity of hydrogen peroxide.",Geri_Science_2020,"Based on the search through the document, the specific references to ""uMAP,"" ""LiTAG,"" ""MS crosslinking,"" and ""APEX"" in the context of protein labeling were not directly found in the sections accessible from the search results. However, from the context available in the document and general knowledge, I can provide definitions and their utilities for labeling proteins in a lab setting:

1. **uMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**:
   - **Definition**: Although not specifically a protein labeling technique, uMAP is a dimensionality reduction algorithm that is often used in single-cell transcriptomics. It could theoretically be applied to proteomics data for visualizing protein expression data in a lower-dimensional space.
   - **Usefulness**: uMAP is useful for integrating and visualizing complex proteomics datasets, allowing researchers to identify patterns, clusters, or outliers in high-throughput protein expression data. It's more about data analysis post labeling rather than a direct protein labeling technique.

2. **LiTAG**:
   - **Definition**: Referenced in the document as a part of a quantitative proteomics-MS workflow, LiTAG (Light-Inducible Tag) appears to be a method for the labeling of proteins that can be activated by light.
   - **Usefulness**: LiTAG is useful for mapping protein territories within specific cellular compartments, such as mitochondria, offering high temporal resolution and specificity for targeting and identifying proteins in distinct cellular locations【7:0†source】.

3. **MS Crosslinking (Mass Spectrometry Crosslinking)**:
   - **Definition**: A technique that uses mass spectrometry to identify crosslinks between protein residues. It is often used to study the structure and interaction networks of proteins within complexes and assemblies.
   - **Usefulness**: MS crosslinking is essential for elucidating the structure of protein complexes, understanding protein-protein interactions, and identifying interaction sites within and between proteins, which is critical for understanding cellular processes at the molecular level.

4. **APEX (Ascorbate Peroxidase)**:
   - **Definition**: A protein labeling technique that uses a peroxidase enzyme (APEX) for proximity-dependent labeling of proteins. APEX can generate reactive radicals in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and biotin-phenol, tagging nearby proteins with biotin that can then be pulled down and identified by mass spectrometry.
   - **Usefulness**: APEX is useful for studying the spatial and temporal aspects of protein interactions and organelle proteomics. It allows for the precise labeling and identification of proteins in specific cellular compartments or microenvironments, especially useful in situ for complex, dense, or dynamic cellular structures.

These techniques have distinct applications in the lab for studying protein function, interactions, and localization, which are key aspects of cellular biology and biochemistry research.",Hananya_PNAS_2023.pdf,R1,R3,R9,R6,R10,R4,R1,R3,R9,R6,R10,R4,R1,R3,R9,R6,R10,R4,R1,R3,R9,R6,R10,R4,R1,R3,R9,R6,R10,R4,5,5,4,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,4,2,4,4,5,5,4,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5
What does it mean to mix features in machine learning?,"Based on the lecture slides (Chem 5520 Lecture 14 Slide 12), feature is the input into the system which can be considered as the photo of ear from the example. Then, there will be lots of different features (input) added to the system which could be multiplied by weighted. Each feature is mixed under hidden layer to learn the intricate structures in all data and used to get final output.",Chem 5520 Lecture 14,"The concept of ""mixing features"" in machine learning generally refers to combining or manipulating features in various ways to create new features that may provide additional information to a machine learning model, enhancing its ability to learn and make predictions. Although the document you've uploaded does not directly mention the term ""mix features,"" it extensively discusses concepts related to the construction and optimization of features in deep learning models, including model architecture, overfitting, underfitting, generalization, and transfer learning【5†source】.

In practice, mixing features can involve:

- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing ones through operations such as addition, multiplication, or more complex transformations. The goal is to uncover relationships that help the model make better predictions.
- **Feature Interaction**: Explicitly creating features that capture the interaction between two or more features. For example, if two features individually contribute to the outcome, their combination might have a synergistic effect that is not captured when they are considered separately.
- **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**: Such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which combines features in a way that reduces the number of features while retaining most of the information. This can be seen as a form of feature mixing that aims to create new features representing the data more compactly.
- **Embeddings**: Particularly in deep learning, embeddings are a sophisticated way of mixing features. They transform categorical variables into a continuous space where similar values are closer together. This can be thought of as a form of feature mixing where the relations between categories are learned and represented in a compact form.

Feature mixing can lead to models that are more accurate, as they can uncover and utilize complex patterns in the data that might not be apparent or utilized when considering features in isolation. However, care must be taken to avoid overfitting when generating and including new features, as overly complex models may perform well on training data but poorly generalize to new, unseen data.",Moen_NatureMethods_2019.pdf,R3,R8,R1,R6,R9,R4,R3,R8,R1,R6,R9,R4,R3,R8,R1,R6,R9,R4,R3,R8,R1,R6,R9,R4,R3,R8,R1,R6,R9,R4,5,5,5,2,4,1,4,4,3,5,5,2,5,3,5,3,4,1,4,2,5,1,3,3,5,4,5,2,4,2
how can you Design <FILTERED> experiment that uses the PRIME editor to convert all the SOS promoters to dinG (fast) or sulA (slow) promoter sequences or to increase the LexA NTD-CTD linker length?,This is beyond my expertise within the allotted time.,,"To design an experiment that leverages the PRIME editor to alter SOS promoters across dinG (fast) or sulA (slow) sequences, or to extend the LexA NTD-CTD linker length, the following steps can be envisioned based on the exam question outline:

1. **Experiment Overview**:
   - **Objective**: To observe the impact of modifying SOS promoter sequences to either fast (dinG) or slow (sulA) variants, or extending the LexA NTD-CTD linker length on the SOS response. 
   - **Method**: Utilize the PRIME editor system, a CRISPR-based genome editing tool, for precise genomic alterations.

2. **Experiment Design for PRIME Editor Modifications**:
   - **a. Conversion of SOS Promoters**:
     - **Design PRIME Editor Guide RNAs (pegRNAs)**: Craft pegRNAs targeting specific locations within the SOS promoters of interest. These pegRNAs should be designed to replace existing sequences with either dinG or sulA promoter sequences.
     - **Implementation**: Transform bacteria with the PRIME editor components and the designed pegRNAs. The PRIME editor’s reverse transcriptase activity incorporates the desired sequence changes directly into genomic DNA.
   
   - **b. Extension of LexA NTD-CTD Linker**:
     - **Design Strategy**: Create pegRNAs that introduce a series of insertions to elongate the LexA NTD-CTD linker region. This could involve the insertion of specific DNA sequences that translate into additional amino acids within the linker.
     - **Implementation**: Similar to the promoter conversion, implement the designed pegRNAs alongside the PRIME editor components into the bacterial cells.

3. **Monitoring Changes & Results**:
   - **Pre-DNA Damage Assessment**:
     - Utilize a green fluorescent HALO ligand to label existing LexA protein before initiating DNA damage with UV irradiation. This serves to mark the LexA population present before any genomic alterations or DNA damage responses.
   - **Post-DNA Damage Assessment**:
     - After inducing DNA damage, introduce a red fluorescent HALO ligand at later timepoints. This labels newly synthesized LexA proteins, allowing for differentiation between original and new LexA populations.
     - **Expected Outcomes**: Examine HALO-LexA fluorescence over time. Changes in the dynamics of LexA binding, release, and degradation could result from altering the SOS promoter's response speed or LexA linker length. Specifically, modifying promoter sequences to fast (dinG) or slow (sulA) types may alter the timing and intensity of the SOS response. Increasing the LexA NTD-CTD linker length could affect LexA's ability to dimerize, bind DNA, and/or undergo self-cleavage, thus potentially modifying the overall SOS response dynamics.

4. **Hypothesis**:
   - For promoters converted to **dinG**, an accelerated SOS response might be observed, evidenced by quicker LexA degradation (green to red shift in fluorescence).
   - For promoters converted to **sulA**, a delayed response might be expected, manifesting as prolonged green fluorescence before transitioning to red.
   - Extending the LexA linker length may hinder LexA functionality, possibly leading to an altered SOS response visible through changes in fluorescence patterns over time.

The detailed design of pegRNAs, selection of specific insertion sequences for linker extension, and the precise timing for HALO ligand application would require further refinement based on experimental conditions, bacterial strain specifics, and desired outcomes related to LexA function and SOS response modulation【7†source】.",Chem5520_S24_Final_Exam.pdf,R5,R8,R1,R6,R11,R4,R5,R8,R1,R6,R11,R4,R5,R8,R1,R6,R11,R4,R5,R8,R1,R6,R11,R4,R5,R8,R1,R6,R11,R4,5,5,3,1,3,1,3,4,1,1,1,1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1,3,2,1,1,1,3,4,5,1,1,1
SHAPE for use in a study using fatty acids <FILTERED> University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences email: <FILTERED>,"SHAPE (selective 2’-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension) is a method developed to study RNA secondary structures. This technique utilizes electrophilic small molecules such as N-methylisatoic anhydride (NMIA) to acylate 2’-OH of sterically unhindered groups on nucleotides. Primer extension, using a complementary RNA to that in interest, can be used to incorporate nucleotides until termination occurs at sites of acylation. Gel shift assays can then be used to determine which sites are most frequently acylated, to give data on the relative dynamics and solvent exposures of RNA secondary structures.",https://www.nature.com/articles/nchembio.1131#Sec1,"To clarify your request about using SHAPE for a study involving fatty acids at the University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences, it's important to understand that SHAPE (Selective 2'-Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension) is a technique developed for mapping RNA structure at the single nucleotide level by exploiting the chemistry of the RNA itself. It does not directly relate to fatty acids. However, SHAPE might be useful in studies where the interaction between RNA molecules and fatty acids influences RNA structure or function, as it provides detailed information on RNA flexibility and conformation.

In the abstract of the document I have, it is explained that SHAPE uses the reactivity of the RNA ribose hydroxyl groups, which are sensitive to local nucleotide flexibility, to map local structure at every nucleotide in an RNA molecule. The method involves reaction with N-methylisatoic anhydride (NMIA) to detect flexible nucleotides at a high resolution, allowing comprehensive monitoring of RNA structure for molecules of arbitrary sequence and structural complexity【5†source】.

If your interest in SHAPE for a study involving fatty acids is related to how those fatty acids might affect RNA structure, conformation, or function, then understanding RNA structure and flexibility through techniques like SHAPE could be crucial. However, the link between SHAPE and fatty acids in a research context would depend significantly on the specific objectives of your study, such as assessing whether fatty acids influence RNA folding, stability, or interactions with proteins or other molecules through structural changes in the RNA.

How can I use the PRIME editing system described in Tong to make a single base substitution in a DNA sequence?,"In Tong et al, prime editing uses the 3’ extension sequence of the modified single guide RNA to provide a primer binding sequence and a reverse transcription template including the desired edit to target the Cas9 nickase sgRNA. Once the DNA is repaired, mutations are introduced to the target locus. In Tong et al, they used a system with three plasmids for the prime editing. One plasmid is a reporter plasmid which contains the gene encoding a fast folding GFP. A second plasmid carried a constitutive promoter driving transcription. A third plasmid expr4ssed an optimized fusion protein which contains an engineered reverse transcriptase, a flexible linker, and a Cas9 nickase. A fourth plasmid is introduced for multiplexed editing. ",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25541-3,"To use the PRIME editing system described in Tong for making a single base substitution in a DNA sequence, you need to follow a specific process that employs the Cas9n-M-MLV2:PEgRNA complex. This process involves several key steps:

1. Expression of the Cas9n-M-MLV2:PEgRNA complex, which binds to the targeted DNA sequence in an sgRNA-dependent and PAM-dependent manner.
2. The Cas9n domain within the fusion protein nicks the PAM-containing strand, which frees the adjacent DNA sequence.
3. The freed piece of single-stranded DNA then hybridizes to the primer binding site (PBS).
4. This hybridization primes reverse transcription of new DNA, which contains the designed edit based on the reverse transcription template (RTT) within the 3′-extension of the PEgRNA transcript【11†source】.

When it comes to making a single base substitution, the cited work has demonstrated that CRISPR-Prime Editing can achieve editing efficiencies up to 19.9% with 1000 ng/mL of inducer (in the context of their experiments). They also report that while deletion and insertion editing events of similar sized DNA fragments can achieve efficiencies equal to or higher than MAGE3, substitution events showed the lowest efficiency among the tested editing events. However, the editing efficiency did not change significantly with ATc concentrations ranging from 100–500 ng/mL, suggesting that 200 ng/mL of ATc is sufficient for inducing the CRISPR-Prime Editing system in their experiments【13†source】.

To specifically make a single base substitution, you would need to tailor the PEgRNA to encode for the desired base change within its RTT. The process would also require careful design of the sgRNA for targeting and the PBS for successful hybridization and priming of the reverse transcription.",Tong_NatComm_2021.pdf,R3,R8,R1,R6,R9,R4,R3,R8,R1,R6,R9,R4,R3,R8,R1,R6,R9,R4,R3,R8,R1,R6,R9,R4,R3,R8,R1,R6,R9,R4,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,3,4,4,5,5,5,4,5,2,5,5,4,4,4,2,5,4,5,4,5,5,5,4
"For what types of experiments is TIRF typically used? The most obvious use that comes to mind is if youre looking for cells that are expressing some fluorescent, membrane bound protein. If it really is just for probing for membrane fluorescent proteins, does the utility of TIRF and flow cytometry overlap?","TIRF microscopy is typically used to visualize cellular processes and protein dynamics on the surface of cells or at key cellular interfaces. The advent of fluorescently labeling specific cellular regions or individual proteins has expanded the functional uses of TIRF microscopy. Because of the ability to synthetically label membrane components, TIRF can be utilized to monitor specific processes of interest as opposed to those that may occur fluorescent naturally. Flow cytometry is a process by which a solution of single cells is analyzed based on visible light scatter and their fluorescent properties. In this way flow cytometers can give information on the relative concentrations of a mixed population of cells. While both techniques can give valuable information on cell populations, their utility is distinct.",https://journals.biologists.com/jcs/article/96/2/219/60658/Total-internal-reflection-fluorescence-TIRF,"Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy is specifically designed for the precise imaging and analysis of events and molecular dynamics that occur at or near the cell membrane. Its applications are diverse and extend beyond just investigating membrane-bound fluorescent proteins. TIRF is highly effective in studies where it's crucial to visualize spatial-temporal dynamics of molecules with high resolution and specificity near the cell surface, especially in scenarios where cytosolic fluorescence might otherwise obscure the events of interest.

Several specific applications of TIRF reported include:

- **Cytoskeleton Dynamics**: TIRF has enabled insights into the dynamics of the cytoskeleton near the plasma membrane, revealing, for example, that a cortical microtubule network extends immediately adjacent to the plasma membrane and that secretory vesicles stay attached to these microtubules until just before vesicle fusion.

- **Endocytosis**: It allows for the clear observation of processes like endocytic vesicle formation which involves the recruitment of cytosolic proteins to the adherent plasma membrane. Visualizing such processes is complicated with conventional imaging due to background fluorescence.

- **Exocytosis, cell–substrate contact regions, and intracellular signaling**: These are areas that have significantly benefited from TIRF, providing a deeper understanding of cell biology at the molecular level.

The utility of TIRF overlaps with flow cytometry in the sense that both can be used to study proteins associated with the cell membrane, but their applications differ in several key ways:

- **TIRF microscopy** provides a highly localized excitation and imaging capability that is particularly suited to visualize and quantify fluorescence from events occurring immediately adjacent to the cell membrane. It is ideal for real-time, live-cell imaging to observe the dynamics of cellular processes near the cell membrane with high resolution.

- **Flow cytometry**, on the other hand, excels at rapidly analyzing and quantifying physical and chemical characteristics of cells or particles in suspension. It can process thousands of particles per second, providing statistical data on populations rather than high-resolution images of individual events.

Thus, while TIRF and flow cytometry might both be used to study membrane proteins, they do so in fundamentally different contexts and with different outcomes in terms of data and spatial resolution.",Mattheyses_JCellSci_2010.pdf,R3,R5,R6,R1,R4,R11,R3,R5,R6,R1,R4,R11,R3,R5,R6,R1,R4,R11,R3,R5,R6,R1,R4,R11,R3,R5,R6,R1,R4,R11,5,5,5,3,4,3,5,5,5,5,4,3,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,5,5,2,4,3,5,5,5,4,4,5
Explain the protein microarrays used by MacBeath in order to probe for EGFR binding partners,"EGFR is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase that can be challenging to be targeted using the traditional small molecule approach. Macbeath et al. developed small molecule printing (SMP) technique, in which they distribute synthesis beads on polypropylene microtiter plates (one bead/well) and the small synthetic molecules attached to the beads will then be released as they are dissolved in a small amount of solvent. MacBeath et al. use a high-precision robot to pick up a small volume of the compound from each well, deliver about 1 nL of the solution to a defined location on the maleimide-derived glass microscope slides (~150 slides/print run), forming a microscopic spot of the compound on the slide. Each of this compound has a functional group that can participate in covalent link to the slide surface, allowing them to be immobilized on glass slides and arrayed. In other words, the small molecules are “printed” or immobilized on maleimide-derivatized glass slides, and each slide can be probed with a different fluorophore-conjugated protein (in this case is tagged EGFR) using a fluorescent-linked assay (e.g. intensity of the fluorescent spots can correlate to the affinity of the protein for the immobilized compounds). These allows rapid scanning of thousands assays on a single slide using compound released from only one beads. This enables small-molecule binding partner for EGFR and other proteins in drug discovery and research.",CHEM5520_S24_Lecture12b,"The protein microarrays used by MacBeath to probe for EGFR binding partners were designed to systematically investigate the interactions between ErbB receptors (including EGFR) and proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains. This approach was undertaken to achieve a comprehensive, quantitative mapping of protein interactions, focusing on the earliest step in the ErbB signaling pathway: the recruitment of proteins to activated receptors. The core elements of MacBeath's methodology include:

1. **Production and Purification of SH2 and PTB Domains**: MacBeath and his team cloned, expressed, and purified every SH2 and PTB domain encoded in the human genome, amounting to 106 SH2 domains and 41 PTB domains. This effort also included cloning of tandem domain configurations due to their potential altered recognition properties.

2. **Selection of Physiologically Relevant Peptides**: They focused on physiologically relevant interactions by selecting peptides representing experimentally verified or predicted sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on the ErbB receptors, including EGFR. These peptides were synthesized with a phosphotyrosine (pY) residue and a fluorescent dye for visualization. The peptides served as surrogates for the activated receptors.

3. **Use of Protein Microarrays**: By leveraging protein microarray technology, they arranged the purified domains on microarrays. These microarrays were then probed with the synthesized fluorescent peptides at various concentrations to map out interactions. This approach facilitated the handling of a large number of interaction assessments simultaneously.

4. **Quantitative Analysis**: Interactions were quantitatively analyzed based on saturation binding curves generated from probing the arrays with different concentrations of each peptide. Specific interactions were identified by fitting the observed data to a model equation that described the equilibrium binding conditions. Parameters such as the dissociation constant (K_D) and the maximum fluorescence (F_max) were used to quantify and classify the interactions as specific or nonspecific.

This protein microarray technique provided MacBeath and his team with a powerful tool to conduct a large-scale, quantitative analysis of the interactions between the ErbB receptors and a wide array of proteins, revealing new insights into their binding affinities and promiscuity. This approach not only identified many new potential binding partners but also offered a systematic framework for exploring receptor signaling networks in a quantitative manner【5†source】.",Jones_Nature_2006.pdf,R7,R7,R2,R2,R6,R6,R7,R7,R2,R2,R6,R6,R7,R7,R2,R2,R6,R6,R7,R7,R2,R2,R6,R6,R7,R7,R2,R2,R6,R6,5,5,5,5,5,2,4,5,5,4,5,3,4,5,5,5,5,2,2,5,5,4,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,4
"Can you explain the ""bump and hole"" philosophy and what it's useful for? Also explain some upsides and downsides please.","The bump-and-hole strategy achieves selectivity against similar binding sites by creating a small hole in the protein binding site through mutagenesis and introducing a bulky modification to the ligand, allowing it to bind specifically to the mutant protein while avoiding the wild-type protein.1 The bump-and-hole strategy has been applied to protein kinases by engineering specific mutations in the ATP-binding pocket, allowing selective interaction with designed analogs to study kinase signaling pathways, including cell cycle, glucose metabolism, circadian rhythms, and more.1 This strategy is useful for detecting target enzymes for PTM (post-translational modifications, localization, and specific cellular environments.2 However, a major drawback of it is the cell impermeability toward the bumped analogs.","Islam, K. The Bump-and-Hole Tactic: Expanding the Scope of Chemical Genetics. Cell Chem. Biol. 2018, 25 (10), 1171–1184. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2018.07.001.","The ""bump and hole"" strategy is a method used in the field of molecular biology and biochemistry for engineering orthogonal receptor-ligand pairs, which are receptor and ligand pairs that are specifically designed to recognize each other while avoiding interaction with natural (endogenous) proteins and ligands in a cell. This approach involves the introduction of a small modification (the ""bump"") into a ligand that makes it unable to bind to its normal target protein. Concurrently, a complementary modification (the ""hole"") is created in the target protein's binding site, designed to accommodate the bump. Together, these modifications create a new, specific interaction that does not naturally occur, allowing for selective binding of the engineered ligand to the engineered receptor【7:1†source】.

**Utility**: The strategy is particularly useful for exploring the specific functions of proteins within complex biological systems. For example, by creating a specific, engineered ligand-receptor pair, researchers can precisely control the activity of the receptor in a cell, enabling detailed studies of the receptor's role in signaling pathways, the impact of its activation or inhibition on cellular processes, and the exploration of potential therapeutic interventions. This has applications in gene expression studies, protein localization, and the development of targeted therapies.

**Upsides**:
1. **Specificity**: This approach allows for highly specific interaction between an engineered protein and its complementary ligand, avoiding off-target effects that can complicate biological experiments and therapeutic applications【7:1†source】.
2. **Controlled Biological Studies**: It enables unparalleled temporal control over gene expression and protein localization within cells, enhancing the ability to study protein function and signaling pathways in a controlled manner【7:0†source】.
3. **Therapeutic Potential**: The engineered protein-ligand interactions can be used therapeutically, offering a method to precisely target and modulate the function of specific proteins within cells, which is valuable for designing innovative treatments for diseases【7:0†source】.

**Downsides**:
- **Complexity and Resource Intensity**: The design and validation of bump-and-hole pairs require extensive molecular engineering, including mutagenesis to create the hole, synthesis of bumped ligands, and high-resolution structural analysis to confirm the specificity and efficacy of the interactions. This process can be resource-intensive and technically challenging.
- **Risk of Unintended Effects**: While the strategy aims for high specificity, unintended interactions with other cellular components cannot be entirely ruled out, potentially leading to off-target effects that could impact the validity of experimental results or the safety of therapeutic applications.
- **Limited by Structural Knowledge**: Success relies heavily on detailed structural knowledge of the target protein and its natural ligand. In cases where such information is lacking, designing effective bump-and-hole pairs may be challenging.

In summary, the ""bump and hole"" approach is a powerful tool for creating specific, controlled interactions between proteins and ligands, with significant applications in research and potential therapeutic uses. Its success, however, depends on careful design and extensive validation to ensure the specificity and efficacy of the engineered interactions.",Bishop_AnnuRevBiophysBiomolStruct_2000.pdf,R2,R6,R4,R9,R3,R12,R2,R6,R4,R9,R3,R12,R2,R6,R4,R9,R3,R12,R2,R6,R4,R9,R3,R12,R2,R6,R4,R9,R3,R12,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,5
How does caging groups control molecular activity if theyre irreversible?,"In caging strategy, chemical modifications can be used to “cage” the molecule of interest to control its molecular activity and functions. In many cases, the caged strategy entails a photocleavable protecting group (e.g. nitrobenzyl) that can be broken or cleaved upon irradiation with light. The reaction involves cleavage of a covalent bond, and this reaction is irreversible. Upon uncaging, the molecule typically goes from an inactivate state (caged) to an activate state (uncaged), revealing a reactive R group such as phosphate, amines, alcohols, carbonates, etc. In addition, one can design a caged molecules that don’t necessarily have those functional groups; the uncaged molecules may be a reactant or intermediate molecule that can trigger subsequent biochemical reactions or step. Both are ways in which the caging groups control the activity of the molecule of interest even though the reaction is irreversible.",Chem5520_S24_Lecture13b,"Caging groups are used to control molecular activity by temporarily masking active sites or functional groups of molecules, rendering them inactive until they are exposed to specific conditions (such as light) that remove the caging group and thus restore the molecule's activity. These caging groups are not inherently irreversible; rather, their removal is what allows the previously ""caged"" or inactive molecules to become active. This strategy is particularly useful in biological and chemical research for the controlled activation of enzymes, neurotransmitters, and other bioactive molecules, enabling precise studies of cellular processes and signal transduction pathways.

For example, in the context of kinase-mediated protein phosphorylation, which plays a critical role in cell growth and proliferation, the caging technique can be applied to photolytically deprotect polypeptides both in vitro and in vivo. A specific instance described involves a photolabile analog of a protein-kinase-inhibitor peptide that masks a critical arginine residue responsible for its inhibitory activity. Upon exposure to light (photolysis), the inhibitory activity is completely recovered, allowing for targeted activation of the molecule at desired times and locations【7:2†source】.

Similarly, caged polypeptide probes have been designed for applications in immunological studies, where photolysis of caged analogs of apoptosis-inducing molecules results in the active ligand being released to cause apoptosis. This technique demonstrates the reversible nature of caging, where the biological activity of molecules is effectively ""turned on"" by light-induced cleavage of the caging group【7:0†source】.

In summary, caging groups control molecular activity in a reversible manner, with their removal—often through photolysis—restoring the function of the previously inactive molecules. This technique offers a powerful tool for precisely manipulating biological processes in real time, aiding in the study and understanding of complex cellular mechanisms.",Dorman_TIBTech_2000.pdf,R3,R3,R6,R6,R4,R4,R3,R3,R6,R6,R4,R4,R3,R3,R6,R6,R4,R4,R3,R3,R6,R6,R4,R4,R3,R3,R6,R6,R4,R4,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,4,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5
what imaging technique should be used to study crescentin in bacteria?,"Crescentin is a bacterial intermediate filament-like protein. This protein, localized to the bacterial inner cell curvature, is required to maintain the cellular curvature of Caulobacter crescentus. Crescentin can be co-expressed with fluorescent protein GFP to track the protein’s localization in under different conditions, and at different time points or developmental stages within the cells. Crescentin can also be tagged with a small FlAsH/tetracysteine (FlAsH/TC) tag for fluorescent labeling of proteins. The protein can then be imaged for structural details and tracked using techniques such as electron microscopy (EM), light microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Keep in mind that for EM, despite giving high resolution details, the samples must be processed and frozen/immobilized prior to imaging, so this is a relatively destructive method.",Cabeen_EMBOJ_2009,"To study crescentin in bacteria, fluorescence microscopy techniques such as using GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) tagging to visualize crescentin structure in live cells can be used. Moreover, FlAsH staining, which involves tagging crescentin with tetracysteine (TC) tags that bind biarsenical dyes, allowing for fluorescent visualization, is another method mentioned for observing crescentin's behavior and structure inside cells.

what is a good non-natural base and non-natural amino acid pair that can be used to link a protein to a DNA sequence specifically?,"One example of using the unnatural s-y pair in Hirao et al, which can selectively incorporate the unnatural amino acid 3-chlorotyrosine. Another example from Duckworth et at. Showed that the unnatural amino acid p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine could be inserted into a protein sequence which can bind to the surface of DNA, thus mapping DNA binding sites. ",10.2183/pjab.88.345,"A good non-natural base and non-natural amino acid pair that can be used to specifically link a protein to a DNA sequence is the pair of 2-amino-6-(2-thienyl)purine (denoted by s) and pyridin-2-one (denoted by y) for the base pair, in conjunction with the unnatural amino acid, 3-chlorotyrosine. This system utilizes the unnatural base pair s•y developed to expand the genetic code, allowing site-specific incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins.

Give me a rundown on what MS/MS is in biochemistry techniques please,"Tandem mass spectrometry, also known as MS/MS or MS2, is a technique in instrumental analysis where two or more stages of analysis using one or more mass analyzer are performed with an additional reaction step in between these analyses to increase their abilities to analyze chemical samples. A common use of tandem MS is the analysis of biomolecules, such as proteins and peptides. The molecules of a given sample are ionized and the first spectrometer (designated MS1) separates these ions by their mass-to-charge ratio (often given as m/z or m/Q). Ions of a particular m/z-ratio coming from MS1 are selected and then made to split into smaller fragment ions, e.g. by collision-induced dissociation, ion-molecule reaction, or photodissociation. These fragments are then introduced into the second mass spectrometer (MS2), which in turn separates the fragments by their m/z-ratio and detects them. The fragmentation step makes it possible to identify and separate ions that have very similar m/z-ratios in regular mass spectrometers. Consequently, the MS/MS technique is necessary for the accurate sequence analysis of peptide biomarkers by the detection of precursor ions and product ions. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is a hyphenated technique for identifying small molecules, such as peptides, with high-throughput, speed, and resolution, combining the separation capability of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the mass spectrometric ability of MS.",GasNeagu et al. Molecules 2024,"Mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a pivotal technique in biochemistry, especially popular and powerful for identifying, quantifying, and characterizing molecules like proteins from various biological conditions or sample types. Fundamentally, MS/MS involves the use of mass spectrometry to select a particular ion of interest (the ""parent"" ion), fragmenting this ion, and then analyzing the resulting fragments (the ""daughter"" ions) using a second mass spectrometry step. This process allows for the detailed characterization of the structure and composition of molecules.

In MS/MS, the molecule of interest is ionized to form charged particles, or ions. These ions are then accelerated into a mass analyser, which separates them based on their mass-to-charge ratios. In the first stage of MS/MS, a specific parent ion is selected from among all the ions produced. This selection is crucial because it targets the analysis to a molecule (or molecular structure) of interest. The selected ion is then fragmented, usually by collision with a gas (a process known as collision-induced dissociation, CID) in a region of the instrument known as the collision cell. The resulting fragments are characteristic of the structure of the parent ion and provide information about its structure and composition.

The second stage of MS/MS involves the separation and detection of these fragments, again based on their mass-to-charge ratios. This allows for the generation of a spectrum of fragment ions that can be used to infer the structure of the parent molecule. The data generated through MS/MS can be extremely detailed and informative, providing insights into molecular structures, interactions, and dynamics that are difficult or impossible to obtain through other means.

MS/MS has wide applications in proteomics, where it is used to identify proteins and characterize their post-translational modifications, interactions, and functions. It is particularly valuable for analyzing complex mixtures of proteins, as it can provide detailed information about the individual components of these mixtures. The technique is highly sensitive and capable of detecting and quantifying molecules in very low abundance, making it an essential tool in modern biochemical and molecular biological research.

The document I have does not directly define MS/MS but discusses the wide range of tools and processes within MS-based proteomics and the variety of mass analyzers used in the field, such as linear ion traps (LIT), quadrupole ion traps (QIT), mass filters (QMF), and high-resolution Orbitraps【5†source】. This background is useful for understanding the complexity and the analytical capabilities of modern MS/MS instruments and their application in scientific research.",Savaryn_Proteomics_2016.pdf,R8,R4,R6,R1,R4,R11,R8,R4,R6,R1,R4,R11,R8,R4,R6,R1,R4,R11,R8,R4,R6,R1,R4,R11,R8,R4,R6,R1,R4,R11,2,5,5,5,5,4,2,5,5,1,4,1,2,5,4,5,5,5,1,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,4,5
What is SILAC specifically and can it be used for mass spec of isotopically tagged lipids?,"SILAC stands for stable-isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture. It involves growing two populations of cells, one in a medium that contains a 'light' (normal) amino acid and the other in a medium that contains a 'heavy' amino acid. The heavy amino acid can contain 2H instead of H, 13C instead of 12C, or 15N instead of 14N. Incorporation of the heavy amino acid into a peptide leads to a known mass shift compared with the peptide that contains the light version of the amino acid (for example, 6 Da in the case of 13C6-Arg), but to no other chemical changes.In a straightforward expression-proteomics experiment, one cell population is labelled with a light amino acid (population A) and another cell population is labelled with a heavy amino acid (population B). Then the cells are mixed and their proteomes are extracted and measured by MS. Each peptide appears as a pair in the mass spectra � the peptide with lower mass contains the light amino acid and originates from population A, and the peptide with higher mass contains the heavy amino acid and originates from population B. If the SILAC peptide pair appears in a one-to-one ratio then there is no difference in the abundance of this protein between the proteomes. A higher peak intensity from the peptide that contains the heavy amino acid indicates that the protein was more abundant in population B. Because the light and heavy amino acids are chemically identical, except for their mass difference, the ratio of peak intensities in the mass spectrometer directly yields the ratio of the proteins in population A versus population B. If you employ isotopically labeled lipids, the technique is called stable isotope labeling by fatty acids in cell culture (SILFAC) instead of SILAC, where the protocol was modified from that of SILAC.",Mann et al. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006,"SILAC, or Stable Isotope Labeling by Amino acids in Cell culture, is a method used in mass spectrometry (MS) to analyze the dynamics of proteins in cell cultures. The technique involves growing cells in a medium containing stable isotope-labeled amino acids (e.g., heavy isotopes of carbon or nitrogen). As the cells grow, they incorporate these labeled amino acids into their newly synthesized proteins. By comparing the mass spectrometric data of proteins from cells grown in the presence of labeled and unlabeled amino acids, one can quantify differences in protein abundance, post-translational modifications, and protein interactions. This is because the incorporation of the heavier isotopes causes a detectable shift in the mass of peptides and proteins analyzed by MS, allowing for a direct comparison of samples.

Although the document provided talks in general about stable isotope labeling (SIL) techniques, mainly with \(^{13}C\) and \(^{15}N\), for purposes such as determining metabolic fate and pace in metabolomics studies【7:0†source】, it does not specifically mention SILAC or its application to lipids. However, based on what SILAC is fundamentally about—using stable isotopes to label molecules for mass spectrometric analysis—it could theoretically be applied to lipid studies as well, if lipids could similarly be labeled with heavy isotopes in a living system or cell culture. The specific application to lipids, however, would depend on the ability to feed cells with isotopically labeled precursors that are incorporated into lipids.

SILAC itself is primarily described and used for protein analysis. For the analysis of isotopically tagged lipids via mass spectrometry, similar principles apply, but the method's specifics would depend on the metabolic incorporation of stable isotopes into lipids, either through the cell's metabolism or by chemical synthesis of isotopically labeled lipids. This would allow for the study of lipid dynamics, interactions, and changes in abundance, similar to how SILAC is used to study proteins. However, the direct application of SILAC as it is traditionally defined (i.e., involving amino acids in protein synthesis) to lipids would require adaptations or complementary methods that ensure the isotopic labeling of lipids.",Prosser_EMBOReports_2014.pdf,R2,R1,R4,R9,R3,R10,R2,R1,R4,R9,R3,R10,R2,R1,R4,R9,R3,R10,R2,R1,R4,R9,R3,R10,R2,R1,R4,R9,R3,R10,5,4,4,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,4,4,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5
How are tRNA synthetase designed for unnatural amino acid incorporation?,"You start from existing tRNA synthetases and make mutations or genetic fusions to optimize for incorporation of your non-canonical/unnatural amino acid of interest. When you design tRNA synthetase mutants, as opposed to performing selections after making random mutations (= directed evolution), you strategically mutate amino acid binding domain or editing domain, usually based on structural biology information of the starting tRNA synthetases. Mutating amino acid binding domain could alter interactions involved in binding and/or reducing steric clash. Editing domain only exists in some tRNA synthetases; it is a part of a correction mechanism, and mutations in this region could �inactivate� this system and allow for novel substrates.",Lecture 7,"The design of tRNA synthetase for unnatural amino acid incorporation, specifically in the engineering of Escherichia coli tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) for recognizing the nonnatural amino acid 3-iodo-L-tyrosine rather than L-tyrosine, involves mutating certain amino acid residues within the synthetase to change its substrate specificity. This process is illustrated by the introduction of two mutations, Y37V and Q195C, resulting in a TyrRS variant (designated as 37V195C) optimized for the recognition of 3-iodo-L-tyrosine. These modifications enable the engineered enzyme to specifically recognize and incorporate the unnatural amino acid into proteins, leveraging the van der Waals interactions between the altered amino acids in TyrRS (Val-37 and Cys-195) and the iodine atom of 3-iodo-L-tyrosine.

This precise manipulation alters the enzyme's amino acid-binding pocket, making it an effective tool for genetic code expansion to include unnatural amino acids. The engineering strategy varies roles between the two mutations, where the Y37V mutation removes steric hindrance to accommodate the iodine atom of 3-iodo-L-tyrosine, while the Q195C mutation decreases misrecognition of L-tyrosine by the synthetase. This engineered TyrRS is then able to specifically recognize 3-iodo-L-tyrosine and incorporate it into proteins in response to the amber codon, a process that has been successfully applied both in vitro (in a plant translation system) and in vivo (in mammalian cells). The development of such engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is a critical step in the production of proteins containing nonnatural amino acids, which have applications in developing molecular switches, photocrosslinkers, fluorescently labeled probes, and heavy-atom derivatives for x-ray structure determinations.",Kobayashi_PNAS_2004.pdf,R2,R4,R4,R1,R3,R11,R2,R4,R4,R1,R3,R11,R2,R4,R4,R1,R3,R11,R2,R4,R4,R1,R3,R11,R2,R4,R4,R1,R3,R11,5,5,5,4,5,2,5,5,5,2,3,1,5,5,5,3,4,3,5,5,4,2,4,2,5,5,5,5,4,4
what are key parts of the Polyketide synthase enzyme?,"Polyketide synthases (PKSs) are biosynthetic factories, primarily occurring in microbes, for the production of bioactive secondary metabolites, which have applications in medicine as antibiotics, immunosuppressants, and anticancer drugs. PKSs assemble polyketides by stepwise condensation and modification of acyl building blocks. The most versatile class of PKSs, type I PKSs, is organized into dimeric functional modules. Each module contains a condensing region comprising the condensing ketosynthase (KS) and a substrate-loading acyl transferase (AT) domain. Modules may further comprise an optional modifying region that often contains a double-hotdog-fold domain (DH). DH domains can have different enzymatic functions to act as dehydratases, isomerases, branching enzymes, or epimerases. Throughout stepwise polyketide synthesis, the intermediates are tethered to an acyl-carrier protein (ACP) domain. ACPs are integral parts of the multidomain PKS polypeptides and are flanked by flexible peptide linkers. Modular type I PKSs (modPKSs) consist of multiple modules acting as an assembly line. Each module performs one step of chain extension and optional modification of the added moiety and passes on the new intermediate to the KS of the downstream module for the next extension step. Individual modPKS proteins typically consist of two to four modules, and they carry docking domains at their termini, mediating interactions to upstream or downstream modules in the assembly line. A complete assembly line commonly consists of more than 10 modules.",Tittes et al. Sci Adv 2022,"Polyketide synthase (PKS) is a complex enzyme that is composed of multiple modules, each of which is essentially equivalent to a fatty acid synthase. A PKS consists of six modules, with each module carrying out a part of the overall synthesis process rather than the complete set of reactions seen in fatty acid synthesis. This structure allows for the creation of diverse polyketide products.

Each subunit houses two unique modules, defined as a set of covalently linked enzymes that are together responsible for one round of polyketide chain extension and subsequent processing of the polyketide backbone. In addition, DEBS1 and -3 each contain additional catalytic machinery capable of selecting an appropriate primer unit and releasing the final product, respectively. Therefore, polyketide chain length is simply dictated by the number of modules plus the primer unit. As a minimal requirement for chain extension, each module contains a set of three functional domains: a ketosynthase (KS), an acyltransferase (AT), and an acyl carrier protein (ACP). The KS domain both accepts the growing polyketide chain from the previous module and catalyzes the subsequent decarboxylative condensation between this substrate and an ACP-bound methylmalonyl extender unit, introduced by the AT domain. This combined effort affords a new polyketide intermediate extended by two carbon atoms. The elongation product is then modified by optional tailoring domains, including ketoreductases (KRs), dehydratases (DHs), and enoyl reductases (ERs), to yield the fully processed product of each module. The precise composition and specificity of these tailoring enzymes provide much of the diversity in stereochemistry and oxygenation patterns in the final macrocycle.",Khosla et al. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007,"The complete module structure of 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) can be derived from its deduced amino acid sequence, which provides insight into the structural organization and catalytic functions of DEBS. Catalytic domains within DEBS were identified based on homology with equivalent domains in fatty acid synthases. Key characteristics include signature motifs, such as GHSxG for the acyltransferase (AT) domain and GPxxxxxTACSS for the ketosynthase (KS) domain, where the nucleophilic residue is underlined in these motifs. The conserved serine in the LGxDSLxxVE motif indicates the attachment site for the phosphopantetheine arm of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain. Additionally, the NADPH-binding motif GxGxxAxxA is found in both the ketoreductase (KR) and enoyl reductase (ER) domains【7:0†source】.

The sequence alignment also aided in defining the boundaries of individual catalytic domains, with core domains such as KS, AT, and ACP showing higher sequence identity within DEBS and with their counterparts in fatty acid synthases. This high sequence similarity helped in designating the respective N- and C-terminal boundaries of these domains. However, for the reductive domains (KR, DH—dehydratase, ER), their boundaries could not be rigorously defined just by sequence alignments. Nonconserved regions found between adjacent catalytic domains, identified as linkers, vary in length and lack apparent catalytic motifs but are crucial for DEBS's structure and function【7:0†source】.

Structural insights from limited proteolysis have provided further understanding of DEBS’s modular architecture, with experiments showing that proteolytic treatment of intact DEBS proteins results in fragments corresponding to intact modules, or occasionally modules lacking ACP domains. These studies highlight the modularity and partial catalytic activity retention of these modules, with all fragments except the loading didomain found to be homodimeric【7:3†source】.

The schematic representation of DEBS typically depicts a linear arrangement of domains operating in an assembly line manner; however, this falls short of fully describing the complex macromolecular interactions necessary for polyketide synthesis. Changes in the stereochemistry and oxygenation patterns in the final macrocycle are largely dictated by the specific composition and specificity of the so-called tailoring enzymes, which include KR, DH, and ER domains【7:1†source】.

Can you summarize the findings of lysosomal storage diseases in lecture <FILTERED>?,"This was discussed as an example of mass spectrometry applications in diagnostics. Pompe disease and Fabry disease are two different lysosomal storage diseases are disorders caused by dysfunction of different hydrolases that are in independent pathways, resulting in inability to recycle metabolites. Screening newborns for those two diseases with a single LC-MS experiment was described, using GAA substrates as biomarkers for Pompe disease and GLA for Fabry disease � to blood samples they could add substrates and isotopically labeled products as internal standards to orthogonally quantify enzymatic activities. A rigorous statistical analyses were involved to determine the threshold for actual diagnoses.","Lecture 8 (pdf, lecture audio), ","The findings on lysosomal storage diseases, as presented in lecture material from **Parkinson-Lawrence Physiology 2010**, outline the following key points:

- **Lysosomal storage disorders** consist of over 50 different genetic diseases primarily involving the dysfunction of lysosomal hydrolases, crucial for substrate degradation. Dysfunctions in proteins related to vesicular traffic and the biogenesis of lysosomes also contribute to these diseases. Disruptions in lysosomal function lead to the accumulation of undegraded substrates in endosomes and lysosomes, severely compromising cellular function【7†source】.

- **Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS)**, a subset of lysosomal storage disorders, were initially thought to result from the overproduction of glycosaminoglycans. However, it was later understood that these disorders are due to specific lysosomal hydrolase deficiencies, leading to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans. Ten different diseases (types I, II, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, IIID, IV, IVB, VI, and VII) fall under this classification, each caused by a deficiency in a specific enzyme involved in the degradation of glycosaminoglycans. The spectrum of clinical presentations includes somatic, skeletal, and neural dysfunction. Additionally, mucopolysaccharidoses' pathology suggested the secondary accumulation of gangliosides in patients’ brains might contribute to neuropathology, potentially through factors like ectopic dendritogenesis affecting synaptic connectivity and plasticity【11†source】.

These disorders reveal substantial insights into the complex degradation pathways within lysosomes, implications of enzyme dysfunction, and the role of such dysfunctions in broader cellular and physiological contexts.

what is artemisinin and why is it engineered?,"Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from the Chinese medicinal plant Artemisia annua L., is an effective antimalarial agent, especially for multi-drug resistant and cerebral malaria. A. annua used to be the only commercial source of artemisinin. The low concentration of artemisinin in A. annua, ranging from 0.01 to 0.8% of the plant dry weight, made artemisinin relatively expensive and difficult to meet the demand of over 100 million courses of artemisinin-based combinational therapies per year. Since the chemical synthesis of artemisinin has not commercially been feasible, approaches to reduce the price of artemisinin-based antimalarial drugs were thought, which includes production of artemisinic acid, a late-stage chemical precursor of artemisinin, by yeast fermentation, followed by chemical conversion to artemisinin (i.e., semi-synthesis).",Kung et al. Front. Plant Sci. 2018,"Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene endoperoxide with potent antimalarial properties, produced by the plant *Artemisia annua*. It is recommended by the World Health Organization for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria caused by the parasite *Plasmodium falciparum*. The reason for its engineering, or production through synthetic biology, stems from the challenges associated with plant-derived artemisinin, including unstable supply, shortages, and price fluctuations. These challenges complicate the production planning by manufacturers of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which are crucial for treating malaria. A stable and affordable source of artemisinin is essential for ensuring consistent availability of these medications.

Advancements in synthetic biology have led to the development of strains of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (baker's yeast) capable of high-yielding biological production of artemisinic acid, a precursor of artemisinin. This process not only allows for the efficient biosynthetic production of artemisinic acid at commercially relevant concentrations but also includes a scalable chemical process for converting artemisinic acid to artemisinin. This semi-synthetic production method aims to stabilize the supply of artemisinin, facilitate its derivatization into active pharmaceutical ingredients, such as artesunate, and ultimately help incorporate these ingredients into ACTs for widespread use in treating malaria【7†source】.",Paddon_Nature_2013.pdf,R4,R1,R1,R4,R11,R10,R4,R1,R1,R4,R11,R10,R4,R1,R1,R4,R11,R10,R4,R1,R1,R4,R11,R10,R4,R1,R1,R4,R11,R10,5,4,1,4,5,5,5,5,3,4,4,5,5,4,1,4,5,5,5,4,2,4,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5
<FILTERED> HNH relationship to RuvC domains and what about the PAM sequence is recognized by the RNA seed sequence and why does the RuvC domain have to be so far away from the CTD,"They asked 3 questions here.
�	Cas9 HNH relationship to RuvC domains
HNH domain cleaves the complementary strand, while the RuvC domain cleaves the non-complementary strand of target DNA to produce predominantly blunt-ended double-stranded breaks (DSBs). Finally, the DSB is repaired by the host cellular machinery. HNH and RuvC domains are reported to make coordinate actions to generate a double stranded break of the target DNA through differential use of (i) nicking by HNH followed by RuvC cleavage (the TS (target strand) pathway) and (ii) nicking by RuvC followed by HNH cleavage (the NTS (nontarget strand) pathway). Proline substitutions in the arginine-rich bridge helix (BH) exert multiple effects on DNA cleavage mechanism, which highlights the role of the BH in R-loop formation and in conformational dynamics that facilitates TS and NTS cleavages by HNH and RuvC domains, respectively.

�	what about the PAM sequence is recognized by the RNA seed sequence
Cas-9 protein recognizes the PAM sequence at 5?-NGG-3? (N can be any nucleotide base).

If you look at the structure they are next to each other",Asmamaw et al. Biologics 2021,"In the CRISPR-Cas9 system, the HNH and RuvC domains play crucial roles in DNA cleavage, showing a complex relationship characterized by allosteric communication and spatial arrangement critical for function. After the R-loop formation, induced by the guided recognition of target DNA by the CRISPR RNA component, the HNH nuclease domain of Cas9 undergoes a conformational change to a final catalytically competent state, known as the docked (D) state. In this state, the HNH domain cleaves the target strand of DNA, while the RuvC nuclease domain cleaves the opposite, displaced nontarget strand, specifically three base pairs upstream of the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) sequence. The progression to this activated state ensures that both DNA strands are cleaved simultaneously, a process that begins with PAM binding facilitating the activation of both the HNH and RuvC domains. Molecular dynamics simulations have suggested that this activation and subsequent DNA cleavage at both the target and potential off-target sites is allosterically controlled. This means that the conformational change in the HNH domain directly influences the activity of the distantly located RuvC domain, demonstrating an intricate allosteric mechanism that underpins the CRISPR-Cas9 system's function【7:0†source】.

The recognition of the PAM sequence by CRISPR-Cas9 is critical for the initiation of DNA cleavage. The PAM sequence, located immediately downstream of the target DNA sequence, is recognized by the Cas9 protein, not directly by the RNA component. However, this recognition event is crucial for the subsequent steps of target DNA unwinding and guide RNA binding, leading to the formation of the R-loop structure where RNA-DNA hybridization occurs. The requirement for a specific PAM sequence for target location ensures the high specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, enabling it to distinguish between target and non-target sequences within the complex genome.

The spatial separation of the RuvC domain from the HNH domain, including its distance from the Cas9 C-terminal domain (CTD), which is involved in PAM recognition, underscores the modular architecture of the Cas9 protein. This architecture facilitates the sequential activation and function of the distinct nuclease domains—first, the recognition and unwinding of the target DNA, followed by cleavage activities. The physical separation is necessary for the intricate orchestration of DNA binding, unwinding, and cleavage, allowing the system to carefully regulate the cleavage process and minimize off-target effects by ensuring that cleavage only occurs when both the guide RNA has fully hybridized with its target DNA and the PAM sequence has been correctly identified. The allosteric interaction between these domains suggests that Cas9 operates as an integrated system where spatial conformation and domain positioning are crucial for its endonuclease activity, reflecting an evolved balance between specificity, efficiency, and regulatory control of gene editing.

Can you explain PACE biochemistry technique please,"Prof. David Liu�s lab devised a system that exploits the continuous culture and selection of the M13 filamentous bacteriophage (commonly used in phage display) to enable the continuous directed evolution of proteins or nucleic acids. In phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE), E. coli host cells continuously flow through a fixed-volume vessel (the �lagoon�) containing a replicating population of phage DNA vectors (�selection phage�, SP) encoding the gene(s) of interest. 

PACE achieves continuous selection by linking the desired activity to the production of infectious progeny phage containing the evolving gene(s). Phage infection requires protein III (pIII; encoded by gene III), which mediates F pilus binding and host cell entry. Phage lacking pIII are ~108-fold less infectious than wild-type phage. Crucially, the production of infectious phage scales with increasing levels of pIII over concentrations spanning two orders of magnitude.

To couple pIII production to the activity of interest, they deleted gene III from the phage vector and inserted it into an �accessory plasmid� (AP) present in the E. coli host cells. The production of pIII from the AP is dependent on the activity of the evolving gene(s) on the SP. Only phage vectors able to induce sufficient pIII production from the AP will propagate and persist in the lagoon. Because pIII expression level determines the rate of infectious phage production, phage encoding genes that result in a higher level of pIII production will infect more host cells than phage encoding less active genes. Dozens of rounds of evolution can occur in a single day of PACE without human intervention.",Esvelt et al. Nature 2011,"The Phage-Assisted Continuous Evolution (PACE) is a biochemistry technique that dramatically accelerates the evolutionary process to evolve biomolecules with desired properties in the laboratory. Unlike traditional methods that involve discrete rounds of mutation, gene expression, screening or selection, and replication – which require days or longer and frequent human intervention – PACE can perform dozens of rounds of evolution in a single day without human intervention.

PACE works by continuously transferring evolving genes from host cell to host cell through a modified bacteriophage life cycle, in a process that is dependent on the activity of interest. This technique harnesses the continuous culture and selection capabilities of the M13 filamentous bacteriophage, allowing E. coli host cells to flow continuously through a fixed-volume vessel (the 'lagoon') containing replicating phage DNA vectors (‘selection phage’) encoding the gene(s) of interest. This unique setup enables mutations to accumulate only in the selection phage population, allowing for rapid evolution of the encoded biomolecules.

At the core of PACE is the link between the desired gene activity and the production of infectious progeny phage containing the evolving gene(s). This is achieved by deleting gene III from the phage vector – gene III encodes a protein essential for phage infectivity – and instead inserting it into an accessory plasmid in the host E. coli cells. The evolving gene(s) on the selection phage must induce sufficient production of the Gene III product from the accessory plasmid for the phage to propagate and persist in the lagoon. This ensures that only phage vectors encoding genes that lead to higher levels of Gene III product production can successfully infect more host cells, driving the evolution of the desired activity.

PACE also encompasses a mechanism to increase the mutation rate, allowing for a broad exploration of genetic variations through the use of an arabinose-inducible mutagenesis plasmid, which enhances the observed mutation rate by suppressing proofreading and enhancing error-prone lesion bypass during DNA replication in the lagoon.

This cutting-edge technique is not limited to evolving specific types of proteins or nucleic acids but is broad enough to evolve any gene-linked production of Gene III product in E. coli, making PACE a versatile tool for solving directed evolution challenges and answering novel questions in molecular evolution【5†source】.",Esvelt_Nature_2011.pdf,R1,R1,R9,R9,R10,R10,R1,R1,R9,R9,R10,R10,R1,R1,R9,R9,R10,R10,R1,R1,R9,R9,R10,R10,R1,R1,R9,R9,R10,R10,5,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,4,4,5,3,5,2,4,3,4,4,5,5,5,4,5
Can you summarize the MAGE process and uses?,"Multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) was introduced by Prof. George Church�s lab for large-scale programming and evolution of cells.

MAGE setup includes climate-regulated growth chambers with real-time cell density monitors, anti-fouling fluidics for transfer of cells between growth chambers and exchange of media and buffers, and real-time generation of competent cells for transformation with synthetic DNA. Cultures are carried through different chambers at different temperature regimes (30 �C, 42 �C, 4 �C) depending on the necessary MAGE steps (that is, cell growth, heat-shock, cooling). Cells are made electrocompetent by concentration onto a filter membrane and resuspension with wash buffer. Oligos are delivered into cells by electroporation, when ~95% of cells are killed. Hence, the electroporation event serves to both introduce oligos into cells and to dilute the cell population, cells are then recovered and grown to mid-log phase in liquid medium for the subsequent cycle.",Wang et al. Nature 2009,"The Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) process is described for large-scale programming and evolution of cells. MAGE uniquely targets multiple locations on the chromosome for modification either in a single cell or across a population of cells, thereby producing a broad spectrum of genomic diversity. The MAGE process is both cyclical and scalable, allowing for the rapid and continuous generation of a vast array of genetic changes (mismatches, insertions, deletions) through automation. An application of MAGE demonstrated its effectiveness in optimizing the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) biosynthesis pathway in *Escherichia coli* for the enhanced production of the industrially significant isoprenoid, lycopene. This optimization involved the simultaneous modification of 24 genetic components within the DXP pathway using synthetic DNA. The process succeeded in creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic variants per day, leading to the isolation of variants showing more than a fivefold increase in lycopene production within just 3 days. This achievement marks a considerable advancement over conventional metabolic engineering techniques. By facilitating the rapid and parallel evolution of gene networks or genomes, MAGE enables the design and evolution of organisms with newly enhanced or devised properties【7†source】.",Wang_Nature_2009.pdf,R1,R5,R4,R1,R10,R11,R1,R5,R4,R1,R10,R11,R1,R5,R4,R1,R10,R11,R1,R5,R4,R1,R10,R11,R1,R5,R4,R1,R10,R11,4,4,5,4,3,2,4,5,5,5,4,4,5,5,4,3,3,2,3,4,5,2,3,2,4,5,5,4,5,4
